Another leftover background task from the subagents — batch 32 is already done, committed, and closed. Nothing to do here.
--- Batch run #21 finished at Thu Feb 19 18:45:01 PST 2026 ---
Done. Batch 33/55 is complete:

- **6 of 10 posts modified** — affiliate tags updated from `poeticlicen07-20` to `herb-hugo-20`, URLs cleaned to `dp/` format, and a few new links added (Maldon sea salt, masa harina, tortilla press, Mexican oregano)
- **4 posts skipped** — existing links were already valid or posts had no existing links, and Amazon search was returning empty results for new candidates
- Committed and bead closed. Not pushed (as requested).

**Note:** The Amazon search tool was returning empty results for most agents. The `check` command for existing ASINs still worked, so existing link updates went through fine, but new link discovery was limited. You may want to investigate the search tool before the next batch.
--- Batch run #22 finished at Thu Feb 19 18:51:32 PST 2026 ---

**Modified (4 posts):**
- `recipe-beet-rec.md` — Maldon salt link: affiliate tag corrected to `herb-hugo-20`
- `recipe-chana-ch.md` — chaat masala: converted legacy `asin=` format to proper affiliate link
- `recipe-crostini-2.md` — 2 smoked paprika links: fixed format and updated affiliate tag
- `recipe-double-c.md` — cookbook link: modernized from deprecated `astore.amazon.com` URL

**Unchanged (6 posts):** recipe-atayef, recipe-banana-m, recipe-cranberr, recipe-crosti-1, recipe-crostini, recipe-delicata — Amazon search returned empty results for new candidates; existing links (where present) were already valid.
