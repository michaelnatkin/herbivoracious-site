Pilot batch of 20 done (12 links found, 60% hit rate). Remaining 414 posts split into 21 batches of 20. Results tracked in amazon_links.md. Tracking ID: herb-hugo-20. Post list: amazon_links_remaining_posts.txt\n\n## Workflow\n1. Read the batch's line range from amazon_links_remaining_posts.txt to get post filenames\n2. For each post: read content from site/content/posts/\u003cfilename\u003e, identify up to ONE specialty ingredient, book, or kitchen tool worth linking (skip common grocery items, perishables, travel/meta posts)\n3. Use WebSearch to find an Amazon product link for the item\n4. Append a row to amazon_links.md with: post slug | anchor text | product name | Amazon link with ?tag=herb-hugo-20 (or 'skip — reason' if no good match)\n5. Use subagents (Task tool) to process posts in parallel for speed\n\n## Important rules\n- Do NOT insert links into blog posts yet — that's a separate future step\n- Do NOT commit or push — just update amazon_links.md\n- Each post gets at most ONE link — pick the most interesting/unique product\n- Skip posts that are travel, meta, announcements, or only use common ingredients\n- Always include tag=herb-hugo-20 in Amazon URLs\n- Batches 1-4 (lines 1-80) are DONE. Next up is batch 5 (lines 81-100)\n\n## Resuming after context clear\nRun 'bd show herbvivoracious-migration-1ad' to see this workflow, then 'bd ready' to find the next batch. Check amazon_links.md to see where you left off.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"michaelnatkin@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T23:26:46.167281-08:00","created_by":"michaelnatkin","updated_at":"2026-02-16T08:08:49.488532-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-16T08:08:49.488532-08:00","close_reason":"All 414 posts processed across 21 batches.
