It all sounds amazing. Oh. Yum. (and the picture is, of course, gorgeous!!!)\n---Again, thank you for providing vegan options for your recipes, not that this particular recipe would need much modification, but it's always appreciated!!",

      "content": "I made this last night with canned red beets. (Hey...wintertime in Providence...you go with what you've got!) I also forgot to get the cucumber. And had no red onion, so I swapped in 2T of white onions. And no maldon salt. Despite all this (and with the substitution of 1/4-thick slices from a Baguette we got in CT -- nearest thing I've found to the stuff we ate in Grenoble during a sabbatical) my version got rave reviews. Very satisfying to have a recipe where I can use two of the few plants that are still usable (the rosemary bush and the potted chives) too!\n\nI really like the idea of the red-and-yellow beets mix. I might even try adding some purple-haze carrots [check your seed catalogue to see how they look] to the mix this summer.",

We ate at a great Seattle place recently, Steelhead Diner, and they had a beet tartare on their menu too, though it was quite a bit different. The server told us that she occasionally has someone who thinks they ordered beef tartare and it is a rude surprise :).",
