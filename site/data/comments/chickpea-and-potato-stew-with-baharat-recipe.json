      "content": "I've been to many parts of Turkey and have a number of Turkish cookbooks, so your recipe using baharat took me by surprise. I'd never encountered it before. I asked my DH, who speaks Turkish, if he knew anything about it. He said it's an Arabic loan word which simply means 'spice.' Looking at the spice profile, I'm guessing that this mix is really only used in the Turkish SE near Syria, where Arab influence is strong and tastes run to the richly spicy.\n\nNevertheless, your recipe looks fabulous and I've gotta try it. Thanks for the post!",

      "content": "I would say they are moderately similar. Ras el hanout especially can vary quite a bit depending on who makes it. Tasting the pair that I have in my spice drawer right now, I'd say the ras el hanout is hotter and has more unusual flavors like rose etc. They both certainly share a lot of the more common flavors like coriander, cumin, and black pepper.",

My husband usually depends on leftovers for lunch the following day and he had to pack a peanut butter sandwich today, since there was only a little left.  This was delicious.  I added chopped spinich to make it have something green in it and we are definitely making it again.",

      "content": "So aromatic and delicious. The Yukon Golds at my local market looked a bit worn and torn, so I used sweet potatoes, which to me were lots of fun.\n\nI have a question. I made chickpeas from scratch for the first time as a part of this dish, and wow, they are like a totally different bean from the canned. My question is that the flavor of the fresh chickpeas was quite naked and assertive - the chickpeas sort of felt too independent from the rest of the flavors. I am wondering if there is a way to get them to feel a little more nuanced and infused with the surrounding spices. Maybe I didn't simmer them long enough? Any suggestions?",
