I've come across Indian recipes where regular chickpeas (kabouli chana) are cooked with the addition of black tea.  I've tried it myself and, while it doesn't seem to add to the flavor, it turns the tan chickpeas a darker shade of brown.  I've often wondered whether the tea is added just so the kabouli channa will look like the more desirable kala chana.  Have you heard of this?",

      "content": "Dave - thanks for the comment..interesting.  I have never heard of adding tea in order to color/stain chickpeas, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  Kala chana is actually a very common bean in Indian cuisine in India, just not common here in the States.  So if you can find it in an indian store, then go with it.  Otherwise, I would substitute with regular chickpeas.",

      "content": "My wife made this last night. It was pretty good. I can't detect any substantial flavor difference between regular chana and the black chana. There IS a texture difference -- the black chana's skins retain a slightly chewy texture. Aside from tripling the recipe (leftovers for lunches!), we followed it exactly. Despite the 18 hour soak and the 45-min cooldown, I still found the chana a little too chewy for my tastes, which surprised me a good deal. If you like your chickpeas as soft as the ones that come in a can, you'll need to cook this even longer.(!) If we were making it again, I might also go with a couple more tomatoes to increase the acidity of the dish a little bit. It's clearly the sort of recipe where small variations are not critical.",

      "content": "We made this great dish last night and definitely will again. \n\nWe had four observations that we thought might help others when preparing it. \n\nEverything we know about pressure cooking beans comes from the terrific cookbook, _Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure_ by Lorna Sass (that cookbook and _Herbivoracious_ make up a good % of our thoughtfully prepared meals around here). Three observations come from her advice:\n\n1) Those of us who use 'jiggle top' pressure cookers should add 1 tablespoon of oil to the soaked peas and 4 cups of fresh water before bringing to high pressure. The oil helps control foaming. \n\n2) We added the salt *much* later in the recipe (midway through the final 20 minute simmer) because of her advice, \"adding salt or any acid to beans hardens their skins and prevents them from absorbing water properly. At best, cooking time will be retarded; at worst the beans will never become tender no matter how long you cook them.\" She goes on to point out some exceptions for beans with delicate skins, and in some soup/stews where tomatoes or salted stock has minimal impact. Her basic advice, however, \"add salt and acidic ingredients at the end of cooking.\" We wonder John if you tried adding the salt near the end of cooking, if you'd get a less chewy chickpea?\n\n3) That said, we did wind up returning our black chickpeas to high pressure for another 6 minutes after following the instructions above, because we weren't happy with the very chewy texture, and got a softer bean (though one still chewier than we would have expected if using regular dried chickpeas). \n\nFinally, when we got to the final 25 minutes of the recipe the dish was too dry and began sticking to the bottom of the pan. We added a touch more oil, but in a few minutes it was happening again. We wound up adding about 2/3 of a cup of a low sodium vegetable stock (it has tomato in it, and complemented the beautiful color palette of this dish nicely). That kept everything moist for the final simmer, and maybe added a bit more sauce for the rice.\n\nThanks Amee for sharing the recipe!",

      "content": "Regarding the addition of salt, Steve Sando of Rancho Gordo had an interesting piece on his blog recently.  \n\nhttp://www.ranchogordoblog.com/2016/02/an-obvious-point-about-bean-cooking-not-everyone-knows.html\n\nHe regards it as a myth that salt toughens the beans and I tend to agree with him.  What does make a big difference is the pH of the cooking liquid.  Acid definitely makes the beans harder to cook to a creamy internal texture.  Conversely, a base will hasten the cooking. soften the beans and, in my opinion, improve the texture immensely.  I have started putting a small pinch of baking soda into my beans about midway through cooking with noticeable results.  \n\nDisclaimer 1:  I haven't actually tried this with kala channa.\n\nDisclaimer 2: I haven't tried adding the baking soda in a pressure cooker either, so I don't know whether it might promote high levels of foaming.  I might be tempted to do my pressure cook and then, if the beans are still hardish, continue the cooking conventionally with a pinch of baking soda till done.",
