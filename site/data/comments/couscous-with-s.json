      "content": "Looks and sounds delicious. It's not that easy to find good yogurts in general here in the States. Most of them are pretty bland, I think. I guess you've hunted down a good one though. Pricey? I have a hard time paying $4-5  for yogurt -- especially when I know i's staple food in many countries.",

Tonight adapted it based on an empty pantry and little time, but craving for these tastes; used sweet potatoes, less oil, and black beans without cooking the beans in cumin and onions, and it was still delicious!  Thanks!",
