I think he's overreacting.  From what I've read, it's exactly as you've suggested - if you're eating enough, you're most likely already getting enough protein.  Just eat wisely!",

I am not a vegetarian, but I eat vegetarian dinners at least twice a week (and leftovers for lunches) - if not more now that I am pregnant and meat is less appealing - and I have never worried about it at all. I love your ideas and the recipes I've made from here so far have been great.",

If I'm too busy to cook, and too busy to go to Whole Foods rather than the suspicious-produce tiny grocery store near my home, then I eat a lot of grilled cheese sandwiches and freezer pizzas, which I guess makes me the stereotype of a bad vegetarian.

A lot of the examples you posted are also great sources of fiber, iron, calcium, and other B vitamins, while being low (or having no) in saturated fats and cholesterol (not including cheese or eggs). Some of these foods are often healthier than meat-based proteins, because of the other nutrients they carry. Not to focus too heavily on nutritionism =) just that I think it's helpful to point that out every once in a while. Plus veg based proteins are so much easier to cook with, and cleaner.",

      "content": "I don't think you're totally off base, but I do think that this varies a lot among vegetarians.\n\nWhen people ask the \"but how do you get your protein??\" question, I do think there's a fundamental misunderstanding about vegetarianism there.  You're right that it's perfectly easy to get protein in a vegetarian diet, particularly if you're a relatively healthy eater and particularly if you cook regularly.  However, it can be a challenge for some of us.\n\nI grew up in a Diet for A Small Planet family, and my father is excellent at (when he tries) cooking in this well-balanced, healthy-without-thinking-about it way.  A typical dinner might include grains, legumes, and vegetables.  I enjoy eating this way too, but when you get home an hour before bedtime, often it's too much work to chop up and steam a couple of vegetables, cook some rice, heat up some beans, eat, and do the dishes.  There are shortcuts, and I try whenever possible to do weekend cooking to eat throughout the week, but for me a typical day doesn't include 55 g of protein (about what I need, too).  Whenever I've tracked protein I've ended up between 20-30 g, 40 if I'm really trying.  That's because most cheap convenience foods don't have much protein.  Bread and cheese or peanut butter do have some protein, but it's still difficult.  I don't really worry about it, as I don't feel sick or have health problems that I know of, but it is something I'm aware of.",

I also never count up my protein or fat, etc. I know pretty much everything contains a certain amount and as long as I'm not eating junk all day, I should be able to get everything I need. Your calculations (i.e. this post) will be something I reference when I want to get my point across more clearly, thanks for that :)",

I do think vegetarians have to be conscious of their diets, because it's easy to eat a ton of carbs and premade stuff (ick) instead of learning about vegetarian sources of protein, but once you're in the know it becomes second nature to eat a balanced diet.  Plus, it's only in the past 50 years of so that meat has become the centerpiece of ANYONE's diet, which most people don't know.  Such a shame!",

      "content": "Kinda late to the party but I'll post my comment anyway.\n\nGreat article. I suggest that the body needs even less protein than you presented: 10% of one's daily caloric intake coming from protein is more than enough for the body to thrive (some studies suggest that 2.5% is enough to thrive). Mother's milk, composed of only 5% protein, allows a baby to double in size and triple in weight in her first year. I don't see how I would require a larger percentage since I am no longer no longer growing but I've found it difficult to eat less than 10%.\n\nI have been vegetarian for 20 years and am raising three kids who have never eaten meat. We eat some dairy, but not lots - 2-4 l. of milk per week,1-2 containers of yogurt, and a little cheese here and there, for a family of 5 - and we don't eat eggs. We don't eat beans or tofu every day (we don't even eat them every week). Our diet is 80% fruits and vegetables, with the balance in grains, pseudo-grains like quinoa (yum!), nuts, seeds, and quality oils. Probably about 50% raw. Very little sugar and processed foods (though we have pizza night every Friday). \n\nFor example, right now my breakfast is a smoothie made of 3 bananas, 1/2 an avocado, 1 cup frozen blueberries, and two grapefruits (substitute grapefruits for pomegranates when they are in season to significantly boost the nutrition intake) and provides me with 12 grams of protein. I change the fruit mix with the seasons. For dinner, my lunch and dinner plates typically look like this: 50% fresh salad with dressing, nuts, and seeds, 25% cooked veggie prep, and the remaining 25% with grains and/or beans or tofu.\n\nI am not a not really into nutrition, but I do like, from time to time, to check on how I am doing nutrient-wise (cronometer.com is a fantastic resource to that end). Eating as described above, without any concern for protein intake, I easily eat 50-60 grams of protein a day, which is a little lower than your ratio of 0.8 grams of protein per kilo of body weight, and a few percent above my target of 10% of calorie intake from protein. \n\nFurthermore, I am very active with a physically involved job - I don't sit at a desk the whole day and manipulate heavy objects. I train at Crossfit 4 days a week, do yoga, and enjoy many outdoor activities such as cross country skiing in the winter and mountain biking in the summer. I never experience any shortage of energy and have a solid muscle mass, weighting in at 185lbs for a height of 5'9\" (I am overweight according to the BMI, hehe). I could even loose a few pounds if I wanted to be super lean.\n\nMy kids are above average in terms of height and weight, have tons of energy (sometimes it feels like too much) and are very strong.\n\nMany people have commented about the lack of time to prepare healthy meals. An easy way to get a LOT of nutrition in no time all is to eat/drink smoothies. Buy a Blendtec blender, throw in a bunch of fruits and/or veggies, blend, drink up, feel fantastic. Delicious and nutritious with minimal prep time and cleanup.\n\nBest,\nMarc",

Anyone doing that is probably morbidly obese (or will be soon) and needs help from a doctor, not me. Human metabolism is nothing remotely like linear. You can't extrapolate from what happens to body composition when you eat 40% too much and hope to have it tell you what will happen when eating a reasonably normal, healthy diet. If people making dietary recommendations are looking at this for future guidelines, it only reinforces my belief that those guidelines should be taken with a grain of delicious, flaky sea salt. You may have noticed that they change those guidelines constantly anyhow, so why should anyone have confidence to follow them knowing they will probably be obsolete two years later? I think Michael Pollan has it basically right: eat a wide variety of mostly whole foods, not too much, not too processed and don't worry about it.",

Arroz con pollo is for the one percent who can afford pollo; the 99 percent have been eating rice and beans for generations, and they're working hard and not keeling over from protein deficiency.  They're happy, healthy people (although admittedly many of them do look forward to some pollo or puerco for Christmas).  I find that I operate best on simple vegetarian foods like brown rice and chick peas and lentil soup. When I have a cold I make curried lentil, and with enough cayenne and curry powder, who needs chicken soup to cure a cold? That stuff cuts the congestion and gives you lots of protein to make you feel stronger.  I also have trouble digesting meat, so I like vegetarian for how comfortable it is to digest.  If you feel sluggish eating beef, cut the meat!",
