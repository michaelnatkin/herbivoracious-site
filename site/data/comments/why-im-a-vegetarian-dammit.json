I have to admit, however, that I chuckle/sigh at a couple vegetarians I know who don't eat meat \"for health reasons\" and eat nothing but pizza, macaroni & cheese, and alfredo sauce.  Mmmmm, healthy.\n\nRE: Vegetarian meals/menus in general, I much, much prefer meals that don't use \"meat substitutes\" and that just simply showcase the veggies themselves.  I've always wondered who the intended clientele are at vegetarian restaurants like Bamboo Garden that serve Kung Pao \"Chicken\" or \"Beef\" Fried Rice -- recent converts to going veg?  Who else would crave that stuff?  Anyway...\n\nAs for rattling off the URL, might want to use a URL shortener first.  ;)",

I became a vegetarian about 21 years ago for all of the same reasons, although I occasionally eat fish now, so I'm actually pescetarian.\n\nI hope you do open a restaurant someday. I typically avoid vegetarian restaurants, because most of them don't really seem to appreciate food. I much prefer to good to a good restaurant, even if my choices are limited to one or two vegetarian items. I would love to see a place in town that was vegetarian AND had great food. Good luck!",

On the rare occasion I will eat chicken or fish but I have a sense of guilt that accompanies those meals and I think it's only a matter of time before I completely give up meat all together. I was a vegetarian for nine years before I started eating meat again and since then I'm unable to digest red meat properly. It's an odd side affect but perhaps a blessing in disguise.",

My husband and almost everyone I know eats meat and I have no problem with that.  I am raising my boys to be veg until the day they can tell me they want to be otherwise.\n\nI feel the same tugs toward meat that you do although I have no desire to every actually eat it again.  As a foodie, cook, and personal chef, I realize there is small but very important (in our culture) part of the puzzle that I am not sharing in.  And yes, putting together a vegetarian feast is vastly more complicated than throwing a steak on the grill.  At times I feel frustrated by these things and often I feel frustrated by our crazy lack of any good veg food in Seattle.  So, why don't you and I open something?  :)",

I was really loving this post, but in the back of my head I kept wondering when you would get to the dairy and egg questions.  \"I'm simply not willing to go vegan\" really left me feeling robbed.  You have some very moral stances then this huge cop out.  I think you should challenge yourself a little more.  You say you never want to support cruelty to animals and then you justify so-called kinder cheese and eggs.  Do you think the animals are happy to be there in this \"kind\" world?  No.  Your conscience is just relieved of its guilt.  You lost me.....\nAny animal life saved is a good thing.  And I applaud any efforts.  But challenge yourself.  Aim higher!

      "content": "Amazing! When I became a vegetarian at 13 years of age it wasn't for health or the environment, it was because I couldn't separate the living, feeling animals that I love from the food that was going in my mouth. Now, 16 years later, I feel like you - the health and environmental reasons are a bonus! It's interesting how so many of us vegetarians are always worried that people will think we're judging them for eating meat. I have been judged, made fun of, and given the 3-degree about my vegetarianism on more occassions than I can count. However, I think now that vegetarianism is more \"main stream\" than it was 16 years ago, it's more accepted. Plus more meat eaters are happy to enjoy vegetarian meals. So go for your restaurant dream! Veggie heads and meat eaters will be there licking their lips.",

I've been vegetarian / pescetarian for the last 15 years, and am often asked about it.\n\nThe most interesting quandary with my diet is usually the backlash I receive from strict vegetarians or vegans.  The biggest benefit is that many non-vegetarians really enjoy my vegetarian meals--I have a lot of people say, \"I've never had this vegetable before!\"\n\nI cooked in restaurants for years, and even ran the grill most recently.  So, I will cook meat for my husband, trying again to go the most ethical route in the meat case.  Weird little mind games, I guess.  Its fairly convoluted, all together ;)",

She died -- suffering a lot- a year and a half after doctors discovered her illness.\n\nI grew up in a country where meat was the main ingredient... the traditional culture about getting protein and things like this. We always had veggies on the side but not enough. I have never liked the killing of animals but was said it was only for food.\n\nIt took some time to realized the importance of eating more vegetables, fruits, and whole grains but finally made it.\n\nI was lucky to have my children at a right age to make the change. They learned the lesson well and even improved it. They care not only for their own health but also for animals and the environment.\n\nSo here I am cooking healthy for my family... no refined or processed foods... almost everything from scratch. I have being making my own whole wheat bread for all these years. I am also learning how to cook tons of veggie recipes from all over the world... all cultures have something good according to my diet.",

      "content": "I didn't count on that question when I decided to stop eating meat.  And there are days when I'd rather people just not even know I'm a vegetarian, because I get so sick of that!  More than the questions over why, when people work out what I might eat instead -- outloud, in front of me, but not to me -- it drives me insane.  And if one more person tells me to make sure I combine beans with rice to get all the nutrition I need... I might explode.  Okay, rant over.\n\nI've stopped eating meat twice.  Somehow, I got dragged back into complaisance over time.  But my reasons were more abstract then.  It was during high school and college, when student union veggie burgers were kinda gross, but I still loved them.  And then a few years ago, I recommitted to it.  I was eating lamb when it happened.  I was overcome with the realization that what I'd just put into my mouth was not only a living creature, but that it had thoughts.  It could have loved its mother, found joy in life.  I couldn't bear having that inside of me... being a part of what seems so barbaric to me now.  That was the last time I ate meat.  I don't think it is necessarily right for everyone, but I cannot bring myself to consume animals.  It was concrete and more pronounced that the first time around.\n\nThere does seem to be some sort of perception of zealotry.  But I'm a very do-what-feels-right-for-yourself kind of person.  While I wish other people felt the way I do, I don't judge them for not.  So many people don't think of animals while eating their burgers -- sometimes I envy that.  Not thinking about it might have made my life easier.\n\nThere is a need for a restaurant that serves great food and also happens to be vegetarian.  I'd eat there!  I hate all these overly granola places looking down their noses at me because I like a bit of cheese on my food.  Great post.  Made me think!",

Having been vegetarian for most my life, I found in my younger years I had to defend my reasons for being so. However,it seems today, that many people have explored meatless diets, or are more open to the idea of vegetarianism. I know a lot of people around the world are struggling financially at the moment and can no longer afford to eat meat and have thus become vegetarian out of ncessity. Often though, they are unsure of how to expand their cooking repertoire to include meals which have a good balance of nutrients, including protein. This is why authors of vegetarian blogs like yours should be congratulated - for freely sharing your knowledge and experience of vegetarian cooking. Personally I have followed your blog for quite some time and find it inspiring. Your words in this post were affirming and encouraging.",

I really do understand where you're coming from and have much the same viewpoint in regard to the reasons behind WHY I eat what I do. I do happen to be vegan, partially because I'm allergic to milk, but I also think the egg and dairy industries are perhaps even more awful and cruel even than other animal production. To each their own. I'm not out to convert anyone to the dark side either.\nI think you're totally correct that being vegetarian (or vegan) requires more creativity in the kitchen, but that's something I am very proud of. I absolutely LOVE stretching my mind a bit to come up with things that are tasty, appealing and yet animal free. My greatest enjoyment comes from taking a recipe and thinking to myself... \"hey, I can make this vegan!!\".\nYour recipes are always so beautiful and creative though, I really am surprised you feel there's a \"significant downside\" to being vegetarian. THAT, my friend, I really don't get!!! You are brilliant at what you do, and the world could USE a few more vegetarian chefs/fine restaurants. Why be like everyone else?

I think I need to do a lot more reading about how dairy and eggs are produced to know how I really feel about it.

It would take a lot to make that change though - I respect the efforts I see to veganize so many things, but honestly I just have never had vegan baked stuff in particular that tasted more than sorta half good (and I&#39;ve tried lots), and eggs and cheese of course have incredible culinary versatility.

      "content": "I understand what you're saying, but you seem to have a big blind spot:  you forget dairy and eggs also come from animals.\n\nTo produce an egg, you have to first create laying hens. 50% of chicks are male, so either are disposed off immediately (killed, ground, then rendered) or are a huge cheap source of meat for the poultry industry.  For the laying hens while they're producing, there is NO government standard to what \"free range\" or \"all natural\" meals.  They could be in the same cramped cages most of their time.  They could be \"cage free\" in a dark chicken house with 5000 other hens, crammed beak to butt.  They can still have beaks cut off as chicks.  Forced starvation cycles are the norm to keep production higher.  And remember, as soon as laying hen stops producing, she's shipped to slaughter.\n\nDairy means you're supporting the meat industry, especially the worst of the worst: veal.  Without dairy creating a cheap source of calves, veal would be unaffordable.  Even the \"happy cow\" dairies must keep the females pregnant every year (forcible impregnantion).  The effort of producing milk and being pregnant drains alot out of an animal ,year after year, and we're so used to seeing the sunken-in look of dairy cows we think it's normal.  In a few years when she can't meet quota, she's shipped to slaughter.   Because dairy cows need milked about 2x a day, they can't have a big range to roam out on; they're far more likely to be chained to a stanchion or living on a small cement-lined pen.\n\nCooking awesome food without eggs/dairy isn't any harder.  I hope you'll consider trying some vegan foods, at least occasionally.   The egg and dairy industry is just as cruel, dirty, and unnecessary as meat production.  It's not just about the killing but the daily suffering we put livestock animals through in the name of culinary pleasure.\n\nThanks for considering my point of view.",

I don't need an animal sacrifice to eat. The way animals are treated in factory farm situations is deplorable to me.\n\nI agree that it is definitely not about health. After all, Airheads candy is vegan- or so I read- hardly the healthiest diet!\n\nI do find it hard to like people who can enjoy especially mean to produce food like veal.

Its funny how many people are threatened by my choice to not eat animal products. I think that's what stems their questioning: they typically feel a need to justify their choice to not be vegetarian. In fact, many people can be quite vicious about it. But I try to say what you said: I am not a judging vegan. I accept what other people choose to eat and how they choose to live. I say: Animals eat animals all the time.

The health factor has become an important aspect for me, but not what got me started.\n\nNow I work for an organization (Sustainable Table) where we teach people about sustainable food. We help people to make educated decisions about what they consume and where they buy it. If a person wants to be a vegetarian, vegan or a carnivore - an especially important issue is - where does the food come from? Buying local, sustainable food (and of course consuming moderate amounts) is very important for our personal health and the health of the planet. All important pieces to consider! I see you have some vegans here making comments about the horrors of factory farming - I totally agree that we need to be conscious about where our food comes from - trying to shop at farmers markets or getting your food through a CSA is very helpful, you can have a chance to ask the farmer what their practices are.\n\nMichael, like that you aren't judgmental about what a person eats, it's wonderful to see so many people making thoughtful decisions about their choices! Thanks for starting this conversation.",

For health reasons, I think fruits, veggies, nuts and seeds should be the main part of the diet. There is no diet that is perfect for everyone. You should eat what makes you happy and feel good. Some people get so protective over their 'vegetarian' or 'vegan' labels that they attach to their diet, but in reality, I think that everyone should just eat what they want for whatever reasons they want (health, environment, taste, animal cruelty).",

My husband and I eat meat, eggs, and dairy products, but we've found that the best way to do so ethically is to eat only those animal products that we are 100% certain come from ethical sources. Of course, the simplest way  for anyone to do this is to have a few chickens. Trust me, just a few lay plenty of eggs for a family. In fact, we have family members who end up giving eggs away every week! While there are many people for whom this would be impossible (apartment dwellers, those in big cities or strictly relegated neighborhoods), the fact that a few ethically treated hens can lay so many eggs means that it isn't at all hard to find fresh, guilt free products at, say, farmers markets.\nThe hardest thing that we have found to work around ethically is dairy- we don't want our OWN cow, and it's quite a bit harder to find like-minded, permacultural friends who keep cows than it is to find those who have chickens.\nAnyway, wonderful, clear article on the ethics of vegetarianism!",

I helped a friend open a vegetarian place, after taking her cooking lessons and I have to say, it was an awesome experience. Vegetarian food doesn't have to be bland at all! :)",

I don't really care about my health or the environment(I mean of course I do but not enough for a dramatic lifestyle change) and I care deeply about animals but that not really it. It just doesn't seem natural to eat a burning piece of flesh. It seems so unatural to me. Looking into an animals eyes is so similar to looking into another human being's eyes. That is the farthest thing from anything I want to put in my mouth. I am a 20 year old that has been a vegetarian since I was 5. My family never encouraged it but it has just always been a natural part of my soul. I will definitely tell people about your article\nThanks again, Lindsay",

And when you purchase any good or service, be it an ear of corn, a book about sex, or getting your air conditioner fixed, are you not exploiting another person somewhere up the chain?  You are!  You are exploiting their labor, taking their time, giving your time and labor, and it all works together.  There is not a loser and a winner behind every transaction, there is a symbiotic relationship at play where all parties achieve a gain.  The same is true for animals that are treated with compassion and allowed to live comfortable lives on farms.  They too are paid in a sense as their lives are protected by farmers.  They get to live without the fear of being eaten, and they are cared for when they are hurt.  They are granted extra years to live, and that is truly the only way you could pay an animal.\n\nAh, but they didn't really have much of a choice now did they?  But at the same time neither does anybody else.  Sure we get to choose HOW we are exploited but we must choose to be exploited in some way nonetheless.  It seems every living animal on earth must be exploited in some fashion or another.",

I give to all sorts of animal causes, and I do my best to treat animals with respect and kindness.  I still eat dairy and egg products, although they're slowly being phased out.  Silk instead of milk, egg replacer instead of eggs in recipes and so on.  Unless you live in a place where there are lots of vegan restaurants (we don't), or are willing to cook _every_ meal at home (we aren't) then it's pretty tough to find anything you can eat.  I haven't eaten anything that's predominantly egg (like quiche and scrambled eggs) for years, because I don't like to support that industry, but it's awfully hard to avoid egg ingredients when you eat out.  Hell - it's usually hard enough just to find out if something has meat in it.  I've never worn fur, and I haven't owned anything made of leather for 15 years.  I don't support animal use in research, hunting, fishing, sports, and so on.  A number of other people are life-long vegetarians because of my influence.  I feel like I'm doing pretty well for someone descended from a long line of cowboys and ranchers, who grew up in the middle of Nebraska.  None of us are perfect, but instead of attacking people for it, maybe you could direct your energies in a more positive direction.\n\n-Bill",

And, like you, I've been vegetarian for about 25 years.\n\nMy trouble is that I live in Mexico now (originally from the US) and people just  don't have any knowledge of vegetarian cooking outside of Mexico City or Guadalajara or Morelia.  In the provinces (I live in Mazatlan) food is considered more tasty with meat or fish stuff added to it.  When I eat in a restaurant I need to make sure I tell them I am a vegetarian, that I don't eat meat or seafood, and I'd like \"whatever\"...the waiter usually says then that they can bring me chicken!  SOmehow chicken isn't meat!\n\nBut I have found a few places that are reliable for me and there is always pizza or cooking for myself.  One natural food store has tofu dogs and you can buy tofu in the grocery store.  But no vegie burgers or that kind of thing here.\n\nANyway, I am bookmarking your site and really looking forward to making some of your recipes.",

Conscious eaters of meat must accept that they make this dubious valuation with every meal, with the consequence that animals die in order to satisfy their personal preferences.\n\nThe word \"should\" has not been used at all in this post.

      "content": "I've always seen myself as a \"potential vegetarian\" or an omnivore with vegeterian tendencies, or whatever, but that was never something I gave thoughts about.\n\nSince childhood I've prefered salads and vegetables over meat - with the exception of fish. But you know, living with people who eat meat all the time, you end up eating meat too, even not liking it at all.\n\nWell, I went to Argentina, my favorite neighbour country (time to say, I'm Brazilian). In Argentina all they eat is meat. They are much more carnivores than omnivores. So, that was ok for me, cause since then I didn't have any concern about eating meat, except its taste. But one week of it made me so sick.\n\nWhen I returned to Brazil I thanked so much God or the deities or the powers of nature (you see, I have no standard religion) for the incredible amount of vegetables we have here - I believe it doesn't compare to anywhere in the world. Fresh vegetables! I decided to stop eating meat. Many of my friends were going vegetarian at the same time. Thanks to the Universe and its forces, or to simple coincidence. And most importantly, add to that that my pet dog was run over by a bus and I could see all that suffering and trauma in her eyes. And my own despair. There came the realization that there are feelings between us umans and animals. \"Do animals have feelings?\" is not a necessary question for me, since I have feelings towards them, and that's enough. For your curiosity's sake, she recovered very very well. Dogs are so resistant!\n\nI do very ocasionally eat fish and seafood - so I'm actually pescetarian, which is a specific kind of omnivorism. But meat... since I made my decision I tried meat one more time, but it tasted quite rotten, like a dead thing (which indeed it is). I can't stand the smell of animal fat anymore.\n\nHard to put up with people that think you'll die or get terribly sick if you don't eat meat. So to deal with it I started reading a lot about vegetarianism, and related issues. You know, a little database to try to argue with meat lovers. Most of the texts I've found are just ideological pamphlets, just too irate to be valid. Yours, Michael, is one of the few that address the issue in a nonpassionate, tolerant way. It made me realise that a diet is a matter of choice and should be adressed in a simple, natural way. It's as simple as choosing a pair of shoes to wear (assuming you're not a girl), especially when you feel good about it.",

By not buying meat products, fur, or leather, I feel that I'm doing a significant amount to keep animals from being exploited on my behalf.  By comparison, I don't think that the small amounts of dairy products I eat are going to support a huge, evil industry.  I'd just as soon go vegan, but my housemates (an ovo-lacto vegetarian, and an omnivore) would make that very difficult.  We take turns planning and preparing meals, and while there are never any meat products included, it would be awkward to expect them to limit their cooking to my preferences.  We very much enjoy cooking and eating together, so I'm not sure what the answer is.  I suppose I could make my own vegan meal every night, but that would sort of take the fun out of our dinner nights.  On a related note, do you feel that it's right to force your beliefs on other people via financial means?  I've always let people make their own choices, even if I'm buying dinner at a restaurant.  I don't eat meat myself, but if they choose to, is it right for me to refuse to pay for it, especially knowing that they can't afford to eat out if I don't?  If you can put aside your hostility for a moment, I'd like to know what you would suggest.",

I think it is because you shared yourself with the world!  I'm not a vegetarian, but your recipes look great as does your website.  But recipes don't invite people to share deeply.  This post that reveals you and what makes you tick is a huge invitation for people to interact with you.  Way to go!\n\nIn my coaching practice I spend huge amounts of time and energy with folks helping them to realize that people don't buy products or services ...they buy people!  So the more you reveal yourself, the more attractive a sales proposition you become.  ...and that revealing process is terrifying more most people.  We've all been pretty well trained to protect ourselves by shielding our 'true' self, our authentic self.  It is so much easier to say \"see, look at this great product I can offer you\" than to say \"here I am world, how do you like me?\"\n\nI encourage you to do more of these 'philosophical' postings.  I bet your clients will love it.\n\nCheers\n\nGwen McCauley\n<a href=\"http://www.ouicoach.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ouicoach.com</a>\nfollow me at www.twitter.com/gwenmccauley",

      "content": "I think a piece of the puzzle that some of the vegan arguments are missing, is that not all farming is factory farming.\n\nMy neighbors in our two-family house just built a beautiful, comfortable coop for their three chickens directly below my bedroom. I know the birds by name and personality. In a few weeks, they'll start laying eggs each day, a normal, natural process with no pain or suffering involved; and since the chickens have no need for the unfertilized eggs, my neighbors will eat them. In exchange for that, the birds get free room, board, medical care, and safety from predators, plus lots of petting and treats from our two families. I think that's a pretty sweet deal for a chicken.\n\nI also buy vegetables, herbs, and goat cheese from a local farm where the goats are treated like members of the family, and each goat has her own glamour shot and bio on the farm's Web site. When a goat has kids, the kids stay with her and she's taken out of the milking rotation. They don't sell any of their animals to buyers who are planning to slaughter them. Again, it's a pretty nice life for a goat, in exchange for a little gentle milking.\n\nFactory farming is a horror, and I do my best not to contribute to it - but I don't feel at all guilty about enjoying surplus eggs and milk from well-cared-for animals. If I want to, I can even personally thank them by name.",

I've been a vegetarian for 15 years and I often stick with a simple answer \"I just don't want to eat animals\". I think you've summed it up perfectly here - Still, when I see a pig or a chicken, a cow or a goat or a fish, I just never think \"boy, I'd like to cut your head off, skin you and eat your muscles\". :)\n\nI completely understand how you feel when traveling to places that have amazing food but due to language barriers or cultural differences, sticking to a vegetarian diet may be difficult. That said, with a little patience, I've never had to eat meat because there was nothing else. I think at the end of the day everyone makes their own choice.

      "content": "Hi Michael, I enjoyed reading your piece about why you are vegetarian; I thought it was thoughtful and thought provoking. I was raised as a vegetarian and as an athiest. My parents always believed that both God and meat should be chosen through the careful deliberation that only an adult can possess. It's not to say that these two ideas have anything in common with each other, it is just coincidentally the two things about which my parents believed I should be able to consider and consent to. I studied religion in my Catholic Prep school years, and also ate some meat. Both of these things made me uncomfortable! I suppose familiarity helps, but the idea of believing in something just from pure faith and no concrete evidence seems ludicrous to me, and the idea of eating animals with blood, fat and bones utterly disgusts me.\n\nI often think about my religious beliefs when I am thinking about the diet I have chosen for myself. I can't understand how people can have blind faith, and sometimes I question whether it is that exact faith that leads me to be a vegetarian. Michael Pollan's book, In Defense of Food, explains how scientists have \"nutritionalized\" the foods we eat. Because scientists say it is true, many of us believe it. I often question my beliefs about food as they are based on what I read from scientific research. What we believe today may be disproved tomorrow.\n\nConsidering this, I try to have an open mind about real food. I would never condemn anyone's choice to eat meat. I do think it is time to stand up to the large food companies who study what the American palate enjoys and then create lots of non-food for our consumption. I am really bothered by the obesity epidemic and feel strongly enough to take a stance on that.\n\nBlogging is really a scary thing and you have to have a tough skin. You expose yourself to people who love you as well as to those who may get joy from taking anonymous digs. I admire anyone who is willing to go out on a limb for their ideas. You are perpetuating our innate and unique human traits of free will and consciousness - we choose and we think. I thought about eating meat, and I chose not to. It's really as simple as that!\n\nCheers!",

I had a similar experience with my family religion (and yes, there are a lot of similarities between my choice to be vegan and other people's choice of faith. Another topic...). My parents gave me their best guidance and then let me decide on my own when I was old enough. But we aren't cooking meat for dinner, and my parents never put a cross in the family room.\n\nI am also expecting that my kids' adolescent rebellion will involve tartares and carpaccios, although I can think of much worse things that a teenager could do.",

I'm home visiting family over summer holiday and they didn't take too kindly my choice to not eat me. They say they support me, but are silently judging me. Now I can quote you!\n\nNo judgments, understanding. That's all I'm asking for, and that's what I will give in return. And that's EXACTLY what you gave.\n\nI applaud anyone who has made the choice, and no mater what people say the decision to become veg*n is hard and changing your lifestyle is harder, and that is what people are forgetting. By judging the fact that you sometimes eat eggs/milk products and call lacto-ovo vegetarians idiots, ignorant, etc are forgetting the difference we are still making in the world.\n\nEveryone has the choice, and by being hateful and judgmental (whether to an omnivore, vegetarian, vegan, flexitarian, pescetarian) will get you NO WHERE in this world.\n\nSide not: My best friends and I (most of us are vegetarian or vegan, but as well as the omnivores) are going to open a veg*n cafe, educational camp, and happy farm (although we won't be killing animals...just to be cute)\nand I'm excited that others are wanting to open vegetarian/vegan places too! I live in a state with very little options.\n\nThank You",

I do hope though that when you are questioned in the future about your lifestyle choice that you qualify your remarks by saying that you aren't too concerned about dairy cows and calves and of course chickens who lay eggs or at least admit that you are a slave to your appetite and/or too weak to give up dairy and eggs.  Or maybe you should just say that you don't like eating meat because obviously avoiding cruelty isn't really high on your list of priorities.",

Some have told me that they grew up in vegetarian households, and one day had a lot of meat, and got awfully sick, and then had a revulsion towards meat, even if they had no ethical/etc.  qualms with eating meat.  Others have seen animals slaughtered and didn't want to partake in meat eating after that.  Others (often boomers) were put on vegetarian diets by their doctors to prevent heart attacks. And yet others are vegetarians for different environmental reasons.\n\nI guess, as an omnivore (although one whose diet is largely plant-based), I tend to be curious as to why people make the choices they do about food.  I don't tend to ask as much as I did when I was in high school/college, and I guess it hadn't occurred to me that vegetarians are asked that question so often that it could get annoying to answer it.\n\nWith regards to some of the comments, I hate it when people are aggressively defensive about the choices they make.   I've seen that in a wide cross section of people-- in the food world, I've seen it heavy meat eaters, vegetarian/vegans, people who eat only organic foods, and people who eat mostly processed foods.  I guess sometimes people are so insecure about the choices they make, that they feel that they must put down people who make different choices in order to show that their own choices are \"right,\" but I think that tactic typically backfires.",

      "content": "Really interesting conversation.  The push-pull between vegetarian and vegan.  My reasons for going veggie are exactly like Michael's.  Having learned about how dairy and eggs are produced makes me choose vegan the majority of the time.  Still buy free-range eggs and buy greek yogurt (for the hubby), but know that these choices still contribute to animal suffering.\n\nInteresting too about the back and forth charges of 'being judgmental.'  It certainly is relative, isn't it?  Yes, we can try to justify eating eggs and dairy as more compassionate than meat eating, but the truth is that it really is part of the same overall animal industry that puts animals in unnatural and cruel conditions in order to keep up the human food supply.  The only exception I can think of would be to keep a couple of hens as pets and then eat their unfertilized eggs  when they are laid.\n\nOver the years I've gone back and forth between the kind and tolerant view that Michael has and generally express that to my omnivore friends.  However, at the back of my mind, knowing what I know, I cannot justify my own dairy and egg consumption.  When not expressed, it feels like I'm not being entirely honest with myself and my friends.  So, I can definitely relate to what the accused 'hardliners' like Tony are expressing.\n\nSo, perhaps we can all be kinder to one another, but also acknowledge and understand what the 'hardliners' are expressing?  Sometimes a difficult but real presentation of the awful truth can at least make people think.  Although some people say it's not  'nice' but rather 'harmful to the cause', it really does get to the truth of the matter.  Whether or not we can handle the truth is our own problem.",

I've been a vegetarian since I was 14 and haven't turned back since. While i'm not one of those animal-hugging lovers, I just instinctively feel that it's wrong to kill these animals and eat them for my own pleasure. But again, 80% of the people I live and interact with are Omnivores and I don't judge them for decisions and lifestyle choices they make either.\n\nI've also experienced the \"inconveniences\" of being a vegetarian. It's extremely difficult to have people consider you a true connoisseur of food, and there are some amazing restaurants I can never try because they don't offer any vegetarian options. My dreams of ever competing on The Next Food Network Star, or Top Chef are also shattered everytime I see that the challenge involves cooking some kind of animal!\n\nAnyways, I just thought I'd drop a line and give my 2 cents. It's great to be able to connect with other people who share a passion for food, esp fellow vegetarians.

Actually, if I go to a restaurant and am equally attracted to an option involving meat and an option without, I will choose the option without.\n\nI have a lot of vegetarian and even vegan friends, and I respect their choices, although I have to say that I find it much, much easier to be around vegetarians at meal time. For example, to feed them in my home, or to take them to a restaurant - I can be happy with a vegetarian meal, I tend to struggle to be satisfied with a vegan meal.

The vast majority of farmed animals live on industrial farms, where industry is characterized by the quest to achieve maximum output for minimum input. It's not joyful, I think.\n\nI think you're confusing livestock with pets, actually. My impression, although this may not be fact, is that livestock is most likely to be killed young, as the meat is understandably most tender in younger animals. Dairy cows and goats are an exception. Veterinary care is expensive, so I think I am right in my belief that minor injuries generally go unnoticed and uncared for, and major injuries and illnesses are stopped via death. So nix that, thank you.\n\nFurthermore, the exploitation as you describe it by humans on humans is a result of the society that we, humans, have built up around ourselves. We exploit each other for the benefit of the comfort of the middle and upper classes. Animals are uninvolved in this. Exploitation of an uninvolved party caused by bitterness about being exploited by another human seems slightly unreasonable.",

I thought I'd get it a read.\n\nI was a pescetarian for over a year and a half and I finally gave in and started eating white and red meat because my family members were bothering me. \"Oh, my cooking isn't good enough for you?\" \"Why won't you try the lamb?\" \"Fish is all you eat? Aren't you bored.\" Nag nag nag. I got tired of it and let them all have what they wanted and they all smiled and said, \"We knew you couldn't do it.\" The only people who were understanding about my decision were my parents. My mother eats chicken very seldom, but loves seafood and vegetables (especially yams). My father drinks tea and eats rice..and that's about it. So, they understood me completely.\n\nLately, my health has been a wreck. I'm in and out the hospital, gone through a CAT-scan or two and I'm done with it. So, I decided to choose the vegetarian lifestyle a few days ago.. and I was doing good until we took the corned beef that we had been brining for week out the oven and make Reuben's during class (I happen to go to culinary school... it's hard not eating meat). I ate 3 sandwiches and some fat (gags) and wanted to choke myself by the end of the night. Eww.\n\nI got serious. I signed a pledge that said I would go vegetarian for 30 days... or so I thought. It really said \"vegan,\" but that didn't matter. I would be vegan for 30 days. No one in my school believes I can do it because I'm a carnivore, but I have faith in myself. ^__^ It's been only two days, yet I'm happy and full and I fell back in love with kalamata olives and artichokes. Yum! When the 30 days are over, I will become a full-fledged vegetarian and will (hopefully) not look back on my carnivore days and be nostalgic. Wish me luck!\n\n...Sorry for the wall of text. I don't have many people to talk to about this because they all shut me down. -sigh- Thanks for listening! ^_^",

Thanks for summing up my feelings on vegetarianism pretty much word for word.\n\nOn the vegan thing...I was a vegan for a few years in the early 90s. I found that my heady feelings of self righteousness eventually wore off and since I'd convinced no one around me to go vegan (they were veg though) I became more resentful and ultimately grouchy because I really missed cheese and eggs.\nI figured the animals and vegetarianism in general needed a happy vegetarian rather than a bitter vegan.\n\nMy husband went back to meat eating long ago but our kids 7 and 9 are happily vegetarian. well...mostly.\nLast year the 7 year old expressed an interest in \"chicken fingers\" and sadly he likes them. It was pretty painful for me to watch but we had agreed that when a kid wanted to try meat we had to let him. He still thinks of himself as a vegetarian and maybe he will end up there but that will be his choice.",

      "content": "Like you, Michael, I have been a vegetarian for about 25 years, although for extended periods of time throughout the year, I adopt a \"vegan\" diet (for religious reasons). My choice to go to a vegetarian diet was clinched when, following one of these \"vegan periods\" I came to the realization that I felt so much better when I consumed no meat. I never went back, nor do I miss meat at all. I do miss fish, but not enough to eat it. But the main reason for excluding meat from my diet was the animals - such sweet and gentle creatures.  I just hate the thought of putting them through such horrific treatment so we could fill our bellies with their flesh. Finding good-tasting food was not much of a challenge, though, because of our \"fasting\" periods throughout the year. Lots of beans and greens and veggie dishes - creative and outrageously delicious!\nI really like tofu and want/need to work on creatively using it more in my cooking.  I also enjoy using the meat substitutes on occasion, especially when I am converting some of our traditional (Greek) dishes to accommodate my daughter's vegan diet and my vegetarian diet. A challenging task, but fun - and often surprisingly successful!\nI am not a big dairy consumer, but when I do use eggs I go for the more \"humanely\" produced eggs. I wish I could have my own egg-laying chickens, though! And I do eat a fair amount of yogurt.\nBecause most of my friends and family are omnivores, I will sometimes prepare meat dishes.  Perhaps that is hypocritical. It's complicated...\nLike you, too, my goal is to one day open a restaurant or a catering business. I wish you all the best in your endeavor - you certainly are well on your way to amassing great menu possibilities with the recipes you've been posting! Thanks for sharing them!",

I enjoy eating vegan and gluten-free on occasion, and I'd eventually like to go vegan entirely, but it's just not logical for my current situation (I have little access to vegan food and other resources).

By the time the cut of meat has made it to the store, the animal was long gone and a choice not to eat it hasn't saved the animal, it's a personal choice but nothing more.  Nature is about as natural as one can get.  There is a food chain, and all living things are in it, somehow.  Not accepting that really suggests a discomfort with nature rather than harmony with it.\n\nThe industrial food machine is bad and it's about as big a human embarrassment as there is.  Animal raising done small-scale and as humanely as possible with respectful slaughter is as good as it can get given the industry in question, especially in comparison to what would happen in Nature.\n\nEveryone makes personal choices to make themselves feel better about something, the real question is, what can be done to make a difference for the animals?",

Now, to me, eating a cow would be as bad as eating my dog or my cat. I was squirmish as a child when we watched my grandmother kill 2 chickens every time we went to visit her.   Don't you love the word squirmish?  In my family however, I would not have been allowed to be a vegetarian. I would have been made to sit at the table 'till my plate was cleaned.  When I became a vegetarian as an adult, many in my family were horrified.  They finally accepted it, simply because I am considered the weird one in the family. My brother who has had 5 heart attacks and more than one open heart surgery tells me that I would be healthier if I would eat meat.  I am a diabetic, and because of an accident, I have chronic pain, and am disabled. I became a vegetarian because my daughters did. I wanted us to be able to eat the same things.  Though they made the decision after becoming adults, we still lived together then.  We each had certain health problems, and I wanted to be sure that everyone got the right nutrition.  In public I am usually vegan, because I can't be sure if the eggs being served are cage free.  I can't be sure if the milk has Vit A palmitate and Vit D 3 that are derived from animal or vegetable sources.  I cant be sure if the rennet in the cheese is animal or vegetable based.  It is easier to choose foods that I am fairly certain are vegetarian. I guess my feelings are that I am tired of telling people why I am a vegetarian.  I wouldn't think of asking someone why they eat meat.  People don't want me, as a vegetarian, to judge them; and yet they judge me and ask me to justify my eating habits.

We keep them mostly for eggs but do have some for meat.

      "content": "I've only recently discovered your blog and love it! Your explanation is very close to my own and so well put! One thing you mention, and that I struggle with, is the general feeling that consuming ethical meat, where animals live out better lives and suffer far less cruel deaths, is significantly better than consuming factory farmed meat. I know this to be true, but my own disdain for the two farmers is almost equal. Ultimately, the ethical farmer is still confining an animal, raising it for the purpose of killing it and realizing a profit from its death -- and gets to feel good about it.\n\nI sometimes think of things this way: if someone kidnapped me and confined me for several years but was SUPER nice and loving and awesome to me (maybe he gives me baths and brushes my hair -- thanks!) before finally killing and eating me, that is still pretty creepy stuff, right? How about just kill me right away? I think I would like that better. We would not accept this treatment for women or people with disabilities or minority groups, so why accept it for animals?\n\nUltimately, I think we should not dominate animals just because we can, but because it is right and good, and it is hard to think of dominating animals as being right and good in any instance. The problem for me is that I know my attitude towards this doesn't help the movement. It has the potential to alienate and guilt meat eaters, which is something I think is terribly wrong and not good for anyone. Ultimately I think vegetarians (in my case, vegan) need to be understanding of meat consumption -- it has a long history and is deeply engrained in our culture -- but it's not always easy.",

It took my another 5 years to give up fish, too, but eventually one arrived at my table with the face still on, and that was enough for me.  I cannot look a creature in the eye and then eat it--and I can't want to eat anything that can look back at me.  I have little (not no) judgment about meat eaters--and the judgement I do have has more to do with the mindlessness of it all and the total disconnect.  But I feel in my bones that being a vegetarian was something I was born to be. Other people may not at all feel the same way and I accept this with love, just as I accept that there is a lot that happens in nature that is horrible for me to witness but is also a part of life's truth. I don't expect the carnivores of the world (which no human being is, no matter what they say) to give up being carnivores, and I don't expect omnivores to be something different than who they are, but I fully relish being a vegetarian and wouldn't want to be any different--except, often, a vegan!

We love them and their eggs.  We do not eat the egg if they go broody.  When the egg never hatches, they give up and we feed it to the dogs (or the cat or the chickens).  We used to get milk from a coop, but recently decided to stop doing that too.  We miss cheese like a mother...but we're feeling our hearts getting bigger from not contributing to the cows being kept pregnant year after year.  I just found a woman who owns lots of goats and we've been getting some freaking insane chevre from her.  She makes cheese when they have milk and doesn't when they don't.  I can live with that.\nKeep on working on it, brother.  Being vegetarian is HUGE, don't let the meanies get to you.  If and when you get to the next step, we'll be waiting for you - arms wide open with smiles on our faces and love in our hearts.\nPS Our son still likes to eat meat and although we don't cook it at home, we let him make his own food choices when dining out or at friends; same with cheese.  He doesn't like milk so we're good there.",

      "content": "I really appreciate the way you phrased everything there, it was very non-confrontational while still expressing your reasoning honestly.\n\nI actually suffer from oral allergy syndrome (and I have every pollon allergy, therefore I'm allergic to most fruits and vegetables, and occasionally nuts), so it's not like I have a lot of choice in the matter in being omnivorous.  I do my best to eat fruits and vegetables though, because I really appreciate a wide variety of flavors, the more unusual the better - thus I often frequent vegan and vegetarian blogs for inspiration since those diets are often constricted and more creative as a result.  All the same, it's been difficult since my allergies are often inconsistent.  One day, I could be perfectly fine eating an apple, and the next it feels like someone poured acid in my mouth.  I can't count the number of times where I've had to radically change my diet because I've become spontaneously allergic to key elements of it, but I can't live on meat and cheese alone so sometimes I just have to put up with it.  Fortunately, my reactions have been on the less severe end of the spectrum, but there's always that risk that it could become worse.\n\nWhat makes this exceedingly difficult is how I explain this to people.  My own mother never believed me, and most allergists haven't even heard of it, so she would force foods I was tremendously allergic to down my throat and tell me how horrible and unhealthy I was when I avoided problem foods.  Many people have accused me of flat out lying, and would eat said foods in front of me while telling me how good they were and what a shame it was that I couldn't have any, in an attempt to make me own up to it.  To top it all off, judgmental vegans/vegetarians will force their morality upon whoever will listen everywhere they go (as many of them have already done here), and naturally some of this has wormed its way into my head, making me feel like a horrible person for the way I eat when I hardly have choice in the matter.  Needless to say, this had lead to me having a less than healthy relationship with food, and by proxy a host of eating disorders that I've mostly worked my way through.\n\nBut there you go, I thought I'd share my experience with you since it's fairly unique in its thread.  Now when I say that I really appreciate the way you phrased your reasoning here, I hope the background I just gave you helps you understand just how much.  I will be frequenting your blog quite often, I love your unique take on food.",

I think that everybody should take a step back and ask themselves if they would have killed the animal that they are about to buy.  We go to the grocery store, we are in a hurry and we don't think about what we are buying.  In our minds, chicken breasts are like apples.  I think the supermarkets act as a barrier between us and the death of the animal to give us peace of mind.\nThanks for wonderful recipes!\n- Marie",

      "content": "I was a veg for 12 years, then started eating small amounts of small-farm meat due to my \"Type-O\" isnhness... but I could actually argue both ways for the notion that it's \"natural' for humans to eat meat.  I highly recommend the Anastasia books by Vladimir Megre; I've just read a chapter in which she describes incredible human cultures which offer a very persuasive argument for our natural revulsion at killing living beings.  She describes how it was really the nomadic peoples of the Steppes, who didn't grow produce and didn't have access to wild food, who influenced the Russians to become meat-eaters a thousand years ago...  It's pretty fascinating.\n\n   The other thing you wrote: \"I've also found the argument that vegetarians are responsible for deaths of millions of animals in plowed farm fields to be disturbing and a bit persuasive\" Ok, that is something I've never heard of, so I don't quite know what you mean.  On the one hand, a field is going to be industrially plowed (killing mice, etc, I'm getting?) for hay and grains for animal feed, much more than vegetables.  It seems absurd to say that the minority of Americans who ascribe vegetarian are \"responsible\" for this.  Although, a point you didn't make-- the industrial growing of soybeans in this country is HUGELY depleting to the topsoil and the minerals of the land.  But the culprit here is industrial agriculture, not people who choose not to eat meat.  This is the reason grocery-store-food does not contain the quality of nutrients it once did (CDC studies show this clearly).  And why the magnesium and iodine deficiencies in our population are rampant (which eating meat partially helps reverse; but it's an inefficient solution!)\n\n  Slow food, small farms!  It's great to live in a place like Seattle with conscious growers and markets all around to patronize.  My thing is spreading the word about growing-your-own, even in little boxes in your apartment, if that's what you've got to work with.  Inspiring and educating people about the destructive results of industrial agriculture.  God how I would love to see the people of this country taking back their land.  \n\nHighly recommend the website Pinenut.com and wildcrops.com, for inspiring stories, information, and access to the amazing American pine nut!",

I remember trying to eat them that way once on a drive between Bishop and Lone Pine, California and it was kind of a messy business but maybe I didn't have the right technique :)! Re the issue of animals plowed under in farm fields, I agree - clearly crops raised to be fed to animals are an even bigger source of that problem, and I agree with your point about depleted topsoil as well. My point is only that trying to eat in such a way that you cause no animals to be killed is pretty nearly hopeless. Even small farms, if they use any tractor at all, inevitably end up killing all manner of mice, rabbits, etc. So we have to get comfortable with thinking of matters of degree, not absolutes.",

I agree with most of what's said here but one thing that is repeated frequently is that it's harder to make a vegetarian meal than it is to make a meat based meal. This in my opinion is not true. I do believe it can be hard for somebody that's raised with mainly meaty meals to come up with plenty of vegetarian meals but in general it doesn't take much to make meals without meat. Whether you're making a vegetarian lasagna or one with meat, stir-fry with or without meat, throw some salami on a pizza or choose for some other option, it's really not much difference. Cooking vegetarian meals is fun and easy, and with the thousands of vegetarian recipes one can find online it's not hard to make a vegetarian feast. I would not like people that consider becoming a vegetarian to think that becoming a vegetarian is a huge effort, because it's not, so my vegetarian friends please don't put it like this, ever.

My philosophy has largely stayed the same, now it's backed more by ethics, I can't justify killing a cow for a steak. This lifestyle has been so easy for me to live and yet, recently, very difficult to explain and justify. I started attending culinary school this september, and I find myself facing the issue of whether or not I'm comfortable or am being a hypocrite by cooking meat in my labs. There was period of a month or so where I chose to break my 6 year vegetarianism to try meat before I began culinary school. Hearing from people I admired like Anthony Bourdain that you must be willing to try anything to be a great chef, created a conflict within me. The thing was, every time I had a bite of a burger, some thai pork, or a grilled shrimp or two, I always wondered what all the hype was about. Nothing appealed to me, the textures made me feel sick and the tastes were... bland. When I also started to develop incredible guilt, that honestly kept me up at night, I decided I'd had enough. As an aspiring chef with a certain \"limitation\" I'm starting to learn that my lifestyle is not something to be ridiculed, but it's in fact provided a new challenge, to prove it's validity in the culinary world I so admire!\n\nThank you for sharing, I've really been looking to voice these thoughts that drive me crazy!",

It is a route I've considered myself, but since I'm not willing to cook meat, I've had to make my own way. The reality is that if you are going to be a vegetarian working as a cook in the world of high-end omnivorous restaurants, you are always going to take a certain amount of crap. You'll undoubtedly learn how to use humor and toughness to deflect that crap. And of course the best way to get respect in the kitchen is simply to develop your skills and speed to the point where your own choice of what to eat isn't an issue.",

      "content": "Nice piece. My reasons are very similar, although I am technically pescetarian and environmental and political factors do influence my diet. I would like to go vegan but always seem to run into dilemmas filling the void. Examples:\n1. Soy milk often seems to have a lot of additives, including sweeteners. What can I put in my coffee? Tropical-based milk products? See below.\n2. I love avocado and could replace a good amount of cheese in my diet with it alone. But avocados and other foods I enjoy are often a) shipped long distances (fossil fuels, pollution), b) from unsustainable farms (water usage, pesticides), and c) come from areas that may not be well-regulated, both environmentally and/or labor-wise. Not to mention, farmland usually involves some measure of deforestation. A disturbed environment is more vulnerable to erosion and invasive species.\n\nSo I struggle with trying to be sustainable AND humane (while keeping a diet interesting enough to help me resist processed foods). Any tips are welcome on transitioning to veganism. \n\nI really appreciate the \"perfect being the enemy of the good\" adage, and I am proud to say that my husband is an omni who will occasionally order a veggie burger, sometimes with bacon. No matter what we eat, if we could all just be a little more thoughtful about our choices, and consume a little less, it would be a good thing.",

It makes it very hard to make dinner, as I make a meat based dish for the rest of the family and then I usually eat whatever is left over, potatoes, rice and veggies for example.  I also have a very, very picky son and that adds to the mix of making boring food.  During the day the daughter and I eat vegetarian and she doesn't seem to mind.  I do eat the occassional seafood, but am starting to get away from dairy, very rarely.  I am not sure there is categories for people to put them selves into any more, vegetarian, flexitarian, etc.  I think people should just eat they way they like and we shouldn't judge them, if it's healthy and keeps them healthy, so be it.  I also get tired of being asked what do I eat for protein and have to explain to people there is protein in more food then just meat based products.  Anyhow, love your website and looking forward to the book.

      "content": "Hi Michael,\n\nI'd like to thank you for your blog post, and I hope you don't mind if I borrow your answers to 'Why are you a Vegetarian?'. You were very clear and concise, and came across as non-judgmental (Which is difficult for us to do, since I find it can often be assumed that we are judgmental.) Currently, I'm in Kenya--where the national dish is 'nyama choma', or 'roasted meat'. I find it much more difficult here to explain my vegetarian reasons, but am so thankful for your blog and for this post in particular!\n\nIn addition, I've found the commentary on the vegan/vegetarian debate to be very enlightening. I am a veggie who doesn't eat eggs directly (for reasons I have not exactly yet hammered out), and when I am financially able to, will buy ethically based dairy products as well.\n\nWhat a great, lively discussion!\n\n-Kayla\n\nPS: Even in a country with roasted meat forming a large part of national identity, I did find one delicious vegetarian dish, called 'Vegetables Swahili'. It includes vegetables cooked in a coconut/curry sauce, and is very reminiscent of the Arab/Indian influence. I highly encourage Michael/anyone interested to look it up and give it a try!",

But I must ask - Where and how have you been able to find the most \"ethical\" dairy?\n\nI understand that well kept, loved hens can be a humane source for obtaining eggs. Certain criteria would have to be met though... Since we know what happens to the unwanted male chicks at hatcheries - These hens would either have to be raised \"naturally\" or be \"rescued\" birds... Also these hens would have to be given the very best of care even after their egg laying years were over... By all these conditions I think it's possible to have \"ethical eggs\".\n\nBut how can nonhuman mammal milk ever be? Even in the best of circumstances - A profit oriented dairy must \"dispose\" of the male calves... I'm certain these dairy ranches don't \"share\" the milk with the babies... And do they keep the mothers after they are no longer \"productive\" or do these gentle giants go off to become burgers and pocket books?  \n\nYour post sounds authentic... Like you've done a lot of soul searching - Perhaps you haven't thought out what \"most ethical\" really is?  It would be awesome for you to write a vegan cookbook as your knowledge and talent is obvious... Just got to swing that \"compassion\" over a degree or two - And I'm certain your heart would be the better for it. ;)",

I know she does periodically take culinary school externs there, there was one working when I was there. Because it is so small, it is both a very challenging environment and one where you can earn a ton of responsibility quickly. As far as other places in NYC, unfortunately I didn't eat around a whole lot on that trip, but we did have a very impressive vegetarian dinner at Dovetail on the upper west side, although it is decidedly omnivorous. Certainly worth checking out.",

I was vegetarian for a couple of years, and developed an intolerance to soy.  Not being able to have soy made the vegetarian diet really challenging, so I added some meat back into my diet.  I have been fortunate to live in an area (as an adult) with a lovely farmers market where I can get locally collected milk and eggs, and locally raised meat.\n\nI totally appreciate the vegetarian and vegan lifestyles, but they just don't work for me.  The way I see it, if you know and understand where your food comes from, and do what you can to obtain that meat in a responsible and humane manner, eating meat is just fine.",

      "content": "Hi there!\nI have been a silent follower of your blog :).\nI have been a vegetarian since I was probably 5-6 years old. (I am 27 now). The reason for leaving \"meat\" was because I accompanied my dad to the butcher's shop back in india to get mutton. There they give you fresh meat by killing the animal in their backyard. And I saw the killing of the animal and later the whole butchering process. It was like an on-off switch in my head, that I just decided never to eat what I saw from then on. It was not as difficult to leave it because at that age, I was not particularly fond of meat. I mean, it was just food that was forced on me (like other foods)! I hated eating as a child :D\nThat being said, I never feel I miss out on anything by being a vegetarian. My husband eats non-veg, so do my parents. But then hubby cooks non-veg by himself and I do not have to endure stir-frying, roasting or searing even a dead piece of meat. To me, even that is kind of painful :(",

I first decided to be vegetarian back in 1994 at the age of 14.  What a strange and dramatic decision for a 14 year old.  I can honestly say it really wasn\u2019t initiated with improving my health or saving the animals of the world. I can\u2019t credit myself for anything so noble.  It was just as if a huge lightbulb when off as I saw a piece of chicken on my plate and suddenly connected the well-seasoned \u2018disguised\u2019 bite back to the actual chicken. I saw the chicken itself on my fork and had to just drop it\u2026Immediately! What am I actually eating?!?! You know how they say mind over matter; well this was definitely a lot of mind trumping the delicious wafting smell of my hot meal.  I have never ever been able to separate the actual animal and my food since. It\u2019s a personal decision, one that I don\u2019t believe I have the right to impart on anyone but myself. I do love being vegetarian for the sake of eating vegetables. I love the flavor, array and taste of seasonal veggies.  I love herbs too! I don\u2019t bother with meat alternatives. I figure if you need to feel like you\u2019re eating meat, then just eat meat!  I love legumes as my protein and have discovered so many foods from around the world are indeed vegetarian.  I don\u2019t think I can ever go back and am thrilled to discover your recipes. Can\u2019t wait to host my first vegetarian dinner party and surprise my meat-eating guests with such a creative, tasty variety!  Thank you!",

      "content": "Thank you, Michael, for writing such a wonderful piece and for taking the time to respond to readers comments years after the fact. \n\nThe vegetarians and vegans I have met who have been aggressive about the correctness of their choices often bring up how \"mindless\" it is to eat meat and/or state that omnivores \"lack compassion\". While it is true that many consumers of animal products might fall into these traps, it's not fair to categorize everyone that way. I'm from a family of avid hunters, and have known from a young age that eating meat involves death, sometimes gruesome, of another living thing. As a child, I only ate meat that was from outside the family (if you will) only once or twice a year. As an adult, I remain cognizant of the realities of eating meat. It most certainly is a choice for me. Most often, I choose to eat small quantities of meat, infrequently.\n\nEating meat keeps me humble; it reminds me that I am also an animal, and that I have to participate in the food chain, and that I will inflict - directly or indirectly - suffering upon other beings. That's part of being alive. In a strange way, being a meat eater enforces frequent reflection upon my place in the larger universe, and upon reconciling myself to being part of it. It is almost meditative, a contemplation of the sacredness of life and a reminder of my place. Part of why food is so amazing is that it can provoke these kinds of realizations and conversations. The self righteous vegetarians and vegans who cannot allow other choices to exist in their worldview and discard them as thoughtless or cruel  haven't heard the whole story.\n\nMaybe that's too New Age-y, but wanted to share my perspective. Again, thank you for writing and listening.\n\nAll the best,\nHannah",

Yet I have been able to disassociate the meat on the plate being served to me (I would only buy meat if I had guests) to the living being it used to be for way too many years. I was not able to contend with the social disconnection you mention, (still am struggling with that), and I also did not know how to cook a satisfying vegetarian meal that I would be proud to serve to guests.\n\nIn the past few month I am transitioning into a plant based diet and the most amazing thing is happening. I am suddenly interested in cooking. I was always a reluctant and unimaginative cook but now I can\u2019t stop reading and learning about the magical world of vegetables, legumes and grains and cooking beautiful and delicious food without animals.  I have a long way to go to become a good cook, but now I want to be and for the first time ever I read cookbooks and web sites, try recipes and this year I planted a respectable vegetable and herb garden. \n\nSo thank you for providing this wonderful resource to the community.  I will buy your book and when you open a restaurant in Seattle, I will come.  \n\nYou might be interested in this article which I read today by author and psychologist Melanie Joy Ph.D on Carnism. http://www.forksoverknives.com/dis-ease-of-the-heart-the-psychology-of-eating-animals/   It goes to the \"heart\" of the matter.",

I have been an ovo-lacto vegetarian since 8th grade, and I have gotten a lot of grief over my choice from people who just don't understand how I could manage. It is so simple for me to not eat meat. Some people who are vegetarian for other reasons, I have found, end up going back to eating meat.  But I could never fathom it. The concept of eating flesh simply freaks me out. I am not converting others, or pushing my reasoning on them, and I would appreciate it if more meat-eaters could do the same.\n\nAdditionally, there is a book Eat Right For Your Type which breaks down the history of the type as well as how it makes a difference in diet.  I am type A and dadamo.com/bloodtype_A.htm synthesizes from the book \"Low levels of hydrochloric acid in the stomach and high intestinal disaccharide digestive enzyme levels permit the more efficient digestion of carbohydrates.

      "content": "Great, great piece. I've been a lacto-ovo vegetarian since I was 18, or 10 years ago. I was a strict vegan for two years in the middle of that, but it wasn't good for my mental health or my social life. I'm really happy as a lacto-ovo veg and I think I'll stay this way forever.\n\nI also get this question a LOT and I'm so happy that I can refer people to this article, since I agree with every point you made, both the pros (health, environment, animal rights) and the cons (traveling, missing out on that slab of \"protein\") of vegetarianism. My problem is that people tend to ask me why I'm a vegetarian when we're sitting down to eat together, and often they are eating meat at the time. I try very hard to come across as a non-judgmental vegetarian (which I truly believe that I am) so I usually don't fully go into it because I feel awkward bashing meat eating as they are doing that very thing in front of me.",

      "content": "Thank you for this thoughtful and insightful post. I am sorry you have had to deal with so many...difficult...commenters scattered among the civil ones, and I was disappointed to see that only one or two of those were from intolerant carnivores, with the rest being from vegans. \n\nI myself could not be vegan even if I wanted to, and would struggle with being even vegetarian, due to oral allergy syndrome plus a mild allergy to rice and legumes (including soy) and a tendency toward anemia. It is almost easier to list the fruits and vegetables I *can* eat without consequence than the ones I cannot, and while I am able to tolerate peas and beans up to a point, they must be well-cooked and not in too much quantity at once; I cannot handle soybeans in any quantity that might be called \"eating\" them -- much to my distress when I discovered how delicious edamame is and how I cannot have it, all within the space of a few bites!\n\nAs such, I appreciate your compassionate and respectful stance. As someone with empathic tendencies myself, I understand your \"anthropomorphizing\" and, though it is not something I feel myself, I find it commendable that you have weighed your own feelings and respect them enough to make decisions based on what is necessary for you to live authentically and ethically.",

      "content": "Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I discovered your blog in someone else's, and I like your posts very much!\n\nI switched to a vegetarian diet mainly because of health. I have chronic urticaria (also referred to as hives) January 2012 and was on antihistamines. I got fed up with it and decided to find out the trigger of my urticaria. Through food elimation and reintroduction I discovered that I am allergic to chicken and beef. So I gave up all meat about 2 months ago. My hives have subsided substantially and I am not on antihistamines anymore!\n\nI was a lacto-ovo vegetarian for 5 years. However, I went back to a omnivorous diet because of my husband's job. He is a pastor and he got invited for meals frequently. It's inconvenient for me to be a vegetarian since I always went with him to visit his church members. I only ate meat when \"necessary\". \n\nNow because I am allergic to meat, I am very happy to become a vegetarian again. Even though it's quite inconvenient, I don't think I want to eat meat anymore, because the symptoms of hives are just too scary. I am very thankful that people around me, especially the church members, are quite understanding. :-)",

      "content": "Thoughtful essay.  I quit eating meat about 2-1/2 years ago.  I was moved that direction after reading Mark Bittman's book - Food Matters.  He has a different approach than you, but again, less purist, more incremental.  In that book, he discussed the environmental impact of large scale animal agriculture.  I thought it was important to try to do my part, so I quit eating meat.  Even for a lover of all food, it was not as difficult as I expected.  As my exploration for yummy non meat food continued, I became more aware of the animal welfare issues too.  That has made it easy to stay the course.  I don't like fake meat, but prefer beans, tofu etc  to round out a yummy, healthful veggie meal.  Like you, I have had some difficulty parting ways with dairy and eggs, although VegNews has an interesting focus on non dairy cheeses this issue.  I am hoping to move away from eggs and dairy soon too.   \n\nWith respect to animal cruelty, people also forget that their leather bag or belt used to be a cow.  That realization has struck me of late too.  Consequently, I have been seeking out alternatives for shoes and purses and remarkably have found some good alternatives, especially online.\n\nThanks for the thoughtful article.  I hope you are not just preaching to the choir, but that your incremental approach might influence others to at least think about their food choices.",

I saw the title of this article just before I drove into work this morning and took some time to think about it.\n\nFirst and foremost, I think the decision to remove (or keep/add) meat to ones diet is a mostly personal affair.  I have my reasons, which just so happen to coincide with yours.  \nI'm also guilty of anthropomorphizing animals; I look into the eyes of my dog and know that there is a soul in there.  He feels pain, knows joy and excitement.  From this experience, I surmise that other animals can as well, to varying degrees.  I don't think a fish has the same capacity for emotions as my dog, but I also believe that we should respect life.  The fact that I feel so much better not eating meat is a bonus.\n\nAs I said, this article appeared in my Inbox at the perfect time.  Knowing that others feel the same way regarding vegetarianism only serves to strengthen my resolve.",

      "content": "Hey Michael, \nJust came across this tonight while searching for vegetarian blogs.\n\nAnyways, your post title caught my eye and I decided to see what your reasons are. I like the honesty and humor you put into it.  I myself have toyed with the idea of going vegetarian (or even vegan) simply because it grosses me to handle raw meat, especially chicken or eggs, and sometimes when I put thought into what I'm actually eating (a LEG. a RIB.  A BUTT.  whether it be a cow's, pig's or lamb's it's gross to think it's coming from an animal and going into my mouth). yuck.  \n\nBUT when I put that crisp slice of bacon wrapped shrimp into my mouth all of those thoughts just disappear.  hehe. (If God didn't want us to eat meat he wouldn't make it taste so good!)\n\nI do understand what you mean about how you are feeling for the animal though.  Growing up in Hawaii (I now live in Vacaville, CA) I had the experience of slaughtering a pig and gutting fish.  It was very gross and still disturbs me when I think of the pig dying or the fish.   (It's funny how you mentioned the worm on the hook, to me it was always the hook in the fishes mouth that bothered me!).\n\nI'm not educated enough to know what happens to the large amounts of animals that are farmed for us but I'm sure if I were I'd probably go vegetarian.  Not vegan since I believe it's too easy to raise your own egg laying hens (I've had some back in Hawaii) or to search out a dairy farm where they treat the cows better- and I love me some ice cream!\n\nI say kudos to you for your dietary choice and for sticking to it.  Although I don't plan on becoming Vegetarian any time soon, I do find many vegetarian meals to be pretty darn good (ever tried homemade banana lumpia with a caramel glaze?!  Malasadas?!  How about butter mochi?!  I know, I know all dessert.. okay, I know you've probably had this one: a margheritta panini- dang skippy!).  I also found that being broke means that my family is eating more vegetarian meals since it can be a lot cheaper. I figure if I can't eat meat as often simply because I can't afford it doesn't mean I have to eat plain and boring tasting meals- thus why I'm on your blog.  If you open a restaurant in the future then open one up in the bay area and I'll stop on by!  Just don't go the 'mini' chain restaurant route please, let the food sell itself.    \n\nGood Luck to you!\n\n\n\n(p.s. please excuse all the spelling errors)",

That struck me and I became a vegetarian too.\nIn about a year or so I found my religious path, which is The International Society for Krishna Consciousness. According to the ancient Vedic philosophy non-violence is one of the fundamental principles for the one who wants to advance spiritually. As I was a vegetarian already I didn't have to struggle with giving up meat.\nMy main reason for being a vegetarian now is because this is what God wants from me.",

Just to stir the pot a little further: I know you mentioned that health benefits are incidental to you, not the main reason for being a vegetarian. In my never to never to be humble opinion, (you know whose phrase this is), neither vegetarianism or veganism means anything in terms of health. Pepsi and greasy potato chips fit both categories and are clearly not healthy. How about the new way of looking at food: plant based, no or low free oils diet? It doesn't hurt other living being, sustainable for the planet and is good for our health.\nHave you had your lentils today?\nCiao,\nDina",

You sort of tie the worm on the hook :)  ive pulled up many live worms after hours of catching no fish... same it true for minnows. I can put a minnow on a hook without killing it. you put the hook thru the mouth and out the gill. it doesnt die. it dies when the big fish eats it. I've actually gotten back live worms and minnows from the big fish i catch and reused them. lol. i would eat the whole fish. not wasting any of it. i am mostly vegan now, for health, ethical and environmental reasons. i dont have an issue with being at the top of the food chain, i just have an issue with how unjust and inhumane everything has become. sadly milk isnt gathered the way I remember as a kid but I eat yogurt and cheese occasionally :(",

When anyone asks me why I'm a vegetarian I have a similar answer, 'because I couldn't bring myself to kill an animal myself', and that's the short answer. But then there are those who believe I wasn't given the choice because I was 'brought up that way'. The truth is, whether I decide to start eating meat or not, my parents would respect my decision either way. \nBut I really can't see that happening, because I feel it so strongly. Like you said, I look into their eyes, or hear them squealing and I can't bear to think of what they are going through. I would so love to have your attitude. It really brings me down sometimes to think of the way animals are treated in the world. I hope that I will learn to cope with it the way you do some day. I'm looking forward to following some of your recipes too! This post has inspired me, thank you.",

Initially it was for health reasons - never want to take a statin drug and my allergist suggested the only way to stay off statins was to go vegan.  I saw Forks Over Knives the next week, and became vegan the day after. 6 months later lab work results were beautiful and it had the impact I wanted on health.  Now it's about the compassion for animals.  I've become more aware of the conditions of factory farming -- am horrified.  I also see that there is so much delicious food, so many ethnic markets to explore with different produce, spices, seeds, nuts, chutneys.....that there is nothing to miss by not eating meat, and everything for me to gain by eliminating animals and animal products from my diet. Ask the proprietors how to prepare unfamiliar foods - there's a whole world to explore. It's harder to get gluten free food in restaurants.  I'm always happy with a salad if there's no entree for vegans - it's about being out with friends, more than eating out, and I love cooking at home.  Little by little I'm discovering more places locally with vegan entrees, or vegan side dishes, and am grateful for the community for providing such fare.  I also watch a lot of cooking shows, but lately feel more grossed out by seeing whole animals broken down, imagining how those animals once enjoyed life and are now fodder for a contest.",

I hate the attention it draws to me and always try to keep my eating choices quiet, never drawing attention to myself if i have to ask a waiter if something is made with vegetable broth or a meat based broth. And no matter when its asked or who asks or how loud the group is when the dreaded question is asked, the whole group goes quiet and looks at me just waiting for my answer .... ugh :(  Its a personal choice of mine and i hate the attention it draws as most of our friends are meat eaters. Even my sister-in-law said, \"I've never even MET a vegetarian before!\" \n I haven't eaten meat in about 21 years, i remember my last meat meal, it was a Burger King chicken sandwich thingy.  Yeah, i know, i could have at least chosen something scrumptious!!  But anyway, I too, have always loved animals my whole life and always thought that i knew what they were thinking and feeling, I too could never bait a hook or hunt with my brothers. As a teenager i happend to get a really cool job working with calves (i THOUGHT it was going to be cool!!). It was actually a veal farm where 240 newborn calves came in and were chained in a small stall and forced to drink from buckets a warm slurry of milk replacer and antibiotics. After weeks of working here and raising these babies it was time for them to be \"processed\" and i was offered a calf of my choosing for my freezer if i wanted it. What an eye opener that moment was for me, none of what i was doing had sunk in until that very moment in time. I hated myself for what i had done and hated the world for eating baby calves! I quit my job and got a job at a supermarket. I continued eating meat though because i didnt know i had a choice, I grew up in a family that ate meat at every meal. In my 20s I met a woman that changed my life, i met a vegetarian! A light bulb went off and it was then that i realized that i actually had a CHOICE in what I ate, I realized that I could make a difference in the lives of animals by chosing NOT to eat them! So when that dreaded question is asked of me and the whole room is staring at mea waiting for an answer, I just reply, \"I love animals so much that I choose not to eat them.\"  It never ends there though and i always end up having to defend myself and explain what i do eat if i dont eat meat! What do they think I eat, just how much of their plates are filled with meat only??  Like at Thanksgiving, they say, \"what do you eat if you dont eat turkey?\" I used to say, \"everything else!\", but now I say, \"what do YOU eat at thanksgiving?\" After they say turkey then they start rattling off all the other stuff and I nod and say, \"yup, me too, yup me too, yup me too : ) \"  \nThanks for the great conversation starter, it was good to hear your story and the comments! Great website, great support, thanks for being here with all your great recipes and conversation :)",

When I first saw the video titled \"Meet Your Meat\" I had already adopted more of this way of eating but that ended it for me. No more meat on my plate. And now, when I do purchase any kind of animal product, even for my cats, I will only buy from reputable farms who treat their animals humanely.\n\nThanks for all you do, Michael. Your stats speak for themselves. Well done! Consider me another  follower :)\n\nHealthy Trails,\nHelyn",

      "content": "An excellent and cogent consideration to the reasons that helped you decide to be a vegetarian.  I'm a lacto-ovo vegetarian as well and have had similar thoughts and feelings regarding my decision.  It caused a fair amount of consternation in my family when I chose to be a vegetarian (I was a vegetarian for quite a while when I was in college and gave it up at some point for unknown reasons).  My wife and kids are non-vegetarians and I did it initially as a way to get a hold of my diet - I was 210 lbs (on a 5' 10\" frame) and wanted to lose weight (now, 11 months later I'm 172 lbs and hope to be down to 155 by sometime next year - there are, of course, other factors in this beyond the diet but I don't want to get into that at this time).  I originally became vegetarian from the \"health\" perspective but I have since evolved to where I don't want to be responsible for the death of another creature (or the mistreatment of another creature) to meet my dietary needs.  I have been contemplating putting together my own \"Why I am a vegetarian\" blog post on my website and have been reading what others have been saying in hopes of helping me hone my statement regarding my decision.  Thanks for your post!  It definitely helps me articulate my own thoughts on this issue.",

      "content": "Your post sounds like myself a few years ago. I was vegetarian for a good many years, thinking the same way. The idea of injuring animals just because they taste good was pure insanity to me.\n\nOne day, I got up my courage to actually research those \"zaney\" vegans. They seemed so far fetched, even for me...who admittedly loves animals more than I do people in most cases. What I found regarding the dairy industry was absolutely horrifying. I discovered that eating beef was actually more humane than eating a slice of cheese. btw, I was one of those \"can't live without cheese\" sort of folks. I ate cheese on everything but cereal!\n\nAfter a couple hours of reading different online site's articles and blogshots, I was vegan. 'Never looked back. If you are vegetarian for ethical reasons, I can't stress enough the importance of doing your own research on the dairy industry. Eggs are even worse, unless you have your own yard chickens.\n\nI cannot tell you how angry I've become over the course of the last couple years, having to CONSTANTLY explain my diet to people who really aren't interested in the first place. It's like a game of \"poke the vegan with a stick\" rather than any genuine curiosity or interest. I was blissfully ignorant for years. I hate to admit that I was willingly ignorant, but I was. I just didn't want to give up cheese or eggs! I guess Karma is slapping me in the face by introducing hoards of folks who are doing exactly the same thing. Then, after being pushed into more detail in my explaination, they get offended because I've stated horrid facts that make them feel bad. So...I end up the bad guy?! And never mind me keeping my mouth shut about how nightmarish it is being surrounded by a huge ham, pork loin and whole chickens while making mashed potatoes in the kitchen at Christmas dinner. You might as well have had kitten parts on those platters.\n\nI am finding it more and more difficult to remain tollerant of others' food choices when it involves meat or dairy or seafood. Oh! That's another one I get, \"But you eat SEAFOOD, RIGHT?!\" I really do not want to alienate people, as that simply goes against my hope of opening them to the realities of their choices. But, when I see someone who professes to love animals go to Walmart and buy a basket full of meat and dairy...well. I feel like I'm watching atrocities that must be stopped. \n\nHow do I find my way back to being tollerant and welcoming to people when they are so set upon keeping their eyes wide shut, like I did for long?",

Still not sure how I feel about if, since, as you mentioned, an eating style really is multi-dimensional. Regardless, I think more of how I feel as a complete being in space and time at this moment when I nourish myself. If it makes me smile and feel vibrant, I resume. If it repulses me, I stop. I resonate with your article on many levels and it makes me wonder, are people trying to simply discover why we eat as we do or are they just trying to demystify something they cannot understand? I'm sure it's both and more. It made me realize, rather than be continuously annoyed with just becoming a way I always felt I was (I just, at one point, learned how to be that), I, too, can keep it simple with replying, \"I eat to feel alive!\" That's it for me. Honestly, all of the reasons, just like yours, really can be simplified into one feeling, alive! Thank you!!",

      "content": "Michael, \n\nThanks for your thoughtful essay regarding your dietary lifestyle. My first thought when I read about people constantly question your food choice was that really, it's none of their business! \n\nI know it's not p.c. to go around telling people to mind their business if we hope to have a social life, but I'm puzzled why people are threatened by your dietary choices. Then again, it seems to me that people are threatened by anything that is different from what THEY think should be the norm. \n\nAs for me, I'm a meat eater. I always will be and there's no sense of me pretending that I won't be. I need burgers in my life. I need barbecue. However, I've started to adopt veggie meals into my diet for health reasons. I suffer from health issues that causes fatigue and inflammation. I feel that I need the vitamins, minerals and enzymes that only fruits and veggies can truly provide. Besides, I definitely need the fiber! \n\nI've grown in awe of all the tasty meals that can be made with veggies. This is why I've subscribed to your blog. I want to learn how to enjoy veggies in different ways. Growing up (In the 70s and 80s), I was always taught that eating veggies meant steaming them and eating them plain. Possibly, one could drizzle lemon juice on them and that's it. I'm sorry, there are very few veggies that taste good to me in this way. Also, I'm not the person who can chow down on veggie sticks as snacks. \n\nLately, I've learned that I can use all sorts of seasonings, spices and (Gasp!) even oils such as olive oils to create a delicious veggie meal. I will say that I use butter for my sauteed brussels sprouts, and for my carrots and butternut squash mixture. In order to eat any food, it has to taste good, right?  That's what I'm hoping to learn from you. \n\nBottom line, what does or doesn't go into someone's mouth is their personal choice. If I were any type of vegetarian, I'd simply tell people that I decided to eat in this way for personal reasons. If they didn't like it, they'd quickly be off my friendship/socializing menu, so to speak.",

Vegetarians are not a homogenous group. Is there there anyone else out there who does not eat meat because they just don't want to eat dead animals? Maybe the gross factor is more a reason than the animal suffering factor? Maybe it is like bugs- I try not to kill them if I can just scoop them up and throw them out the door, but if they get killed I am not perseverating on bug suffering, or going around scolding all the bug killers in the neighborhood.\nI grew up 95% vegetarian because my family was lacto-vegetarian for religious reasons. So, not eating meat is part of my culture, and though I am an atheist now, it still feels normal to me. I became 100% vegetarian at 16 after seeing a cow slaughtered for scientific research in a rather humane manner. It really grossed me out. I decided that becoming 100% vegetarian was the easiest way to avoid having that slaughter become my recurring nightmare. \nSo there you go. This is more about me than the animals. Does anyone else out there feel this way?",

Most people are disconnected from life and live unconsciously.  I am an empath and I feel their pain and suffering therefore I understand them.  The animals are my friends and they have been there for me when no one else was.  I love nature and photography and like to capture the animals in the wild.  I am on my own journey and respect others on their own.  You can't teach or preach, people don't like it.  You can just be an example to others with your own life and they can make their own decisions when they are ready.  Everyone has free will!",

Going fishing with my Dad while on camping trips was an experience for me very similar to yours.  BUT, I was raised in a family that did not understand my care of animals - they just saw me as odd and rebellious, which was not at all the case.\n\nNow, I am a long time complete veghead, with two grown sons who are also choosing similar lifestyles, because they see the good health that their mother enjoys.  Not only that, but they were raised by a woman who never stopped feeling toward animals as I did as a child.\n\nThe other day I was driving and spotted a chicken sitting in the road (no, this is NOT a joke).  I stopped my car, got out of my car and talked lovingly to her, scooping her up and depositing her on the seat next to me.  I believe with my whole heart that that chicken was not the least bit fearful of me because she KNEW instinctively that I meant her no harm.  \n\nThanks for this wonderful article.  I shall print it out and keep it in my file with others' reasons for choosing a vegetarian lifestyle.  The reasons are many and varied.  I suppose that I subscribe to them all - seeing my life as being interconnected to all that exists on planet Earth. Kristina",

Carnists want veg'ns to \"let (them) live\" and to \"respect their personal choices\" when they do not practice letting animals live and they do not respect the personal choices of animals toward life, liberty, and the pursuit of their happiness. Animals have rights, and humans do not have the right to deny them their rights--we only steal opportunity. When your lifestyle choices demonstrate respect outside of an anthropocentric world, I will respect them. Otherwise, you should not expect the respect you have not earned. \n\nNote: Do not conflate judgmentalism with anger. If someone killed your loved ones you would be angry, too. If you want compassion you should show at least a little. A flagrant \"carnivore to the core\" is not going to get compassion from veg'ns, just pity.",

Apart from bees the following three:\n\nThe angora rabbits from which we can 'harvest' every 90 to 100 days a long fiber that is soft and insulating to make a beautiful yarn and if hand spun and hand knitted yields a very fluffy knitwear that no machine mill spinning can possibly replicate. \n\nThe oysters that coat an irritant to their soft tissues with a secretion, and in the process, little by little, yield a beautiful Pearl. \n\nA terrestrial mollusk, the helix aspersa brown garden snail that very much like the oyster has an innate immune system that is more evolved than ours and secretes a serum packed with complex molecules made of soluble proteins, glyco (sugar) molecules, oligoelements such as copper, zinc, calcium and enzymes and co-enzymes to heal its skin and even its tentacles where its eyes are when bitten by birds. \n\nThis mollusk also has skin tissues and living cells and organs that are similar to human skin, and scientific research by the dermatology service of The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York postulates its use in regenerative therapy, while there are already natural skin care products made with it. \n\nIn those three experiences I have been directly involved as an entrepreneur and the experience has made me think that I choose to live with gentle people and gentle animals and eating my fellow partners from the animal kingdom just does not feel right or gentle to me. I like to remain in touch with the simple rewards of living our lives together. \n\nCongratulations for your stance and I love the sharing and comments it has brought forth.

      "content": "Hi, I would like to thank you for this wonderful article. This is one article that resonates deeply with me. I started my journey to become a permanent vegetarian 2 months ago. I have always wanted to become a vegetarian and had fast from meat from time to time for various reasons, mainly thanksgiving (ie: after each backpacking trip, i will be vegetarian for a month to give thanks that I had a safe journey). I have always felt that it's just not right to kill animals for their meat. I felt deeply so when I saw pigs being caged in bamboo cages in Vietnam and were being sent to the kitchen. Their eyes were filled with so much sorrow. Then, I had a thought that I would like to be a vegetarian. However, I did not have the courage to face the consequences of being a vegetarian. I had never go on a vegetarian diet for more than 1 month and no one in my social circle is a vegetarian. Last month, I went to India and I was eating as a vegetarian throughout my trip. When I came back, it just clicked. I decided to be a vegetarian for the rest of my life. There were no special incidences. I did not witness any ill-treatment towards animals there. It just happened and I felt that I was ready to give up meat for the rest of my life. This decision is not something I can comprehend, but it's something I knew I wanted to do. The first few weeks were tough as friends and family ask me the reason for going vegetarian. I sometimes felt ridiculous for not being able to give them ONE solid answer because I don't have that answer myself. I just felt that it's the right thing to do as I would not want to harm another living being just for my pleasure. I was challenged in similar manner saying that plants are living being too. I felt stressed when being challenged because I was not able to give an answer that truly represented how I felt. I borrowed answers from other vegetarians because they sounded legitimate. Yet, these reasons are not the main reason, they are just \"by the way\" like what you mentioned. Your words hit all the right notes in my heart. The longer I abstain from meat, the greater empathy I developed for animals. I will never want to see my friends or family being skinned or cooked to serve another living being thus I would not want to do the same to another living being. That being said, I respect everyone's choice in life. My closest people around me still love meat and I am grateful that they are starting to understand that I am serious in this venture and accept who I am. Your site is an inspiration as I am someone who enjoy cooking too. I was slightly frustrated with the limited knowledge I have in cooking vegetarian food and I ended up eating more carbs just because I lack variety in my choice of food. Thank you, for sharing your thoughts. Thank you, for sharing your knowledge and passion about cooking vegetarian food. I am from Malaysia and you have touched a life from the other end of the globe.",

      "content": "I read this post today and I don't understand why you are a vegetarian and not a vegan? If animal welfare issues is your motivation for being a vegetarian, how can you not go all the way for these animals? Please note that I am not trying to judge you, I just want to know what is your logic behind being a vegetarian vs. a vegan?  I went vegan overnight after learning about factory farming - I was an avid chicken eater one day and the next day, I am a vegan. I know not many people can turn vegan overnight, but as soon as I made the connection between the meat on my plate and the animal that it once was - I never look back. If you care about animals, how can you drink milk and use dairy in your recipes? (I know it sounds like I am attacking you, but trust me, I am not, I really just wonder what your logic is to use dairy if you care about animals). In order to make milk for humans, mother cows are repeatedly impregnated on what the beef industry called a \"rape rack\" - as soon as the calfs are borned, they are taken away from the mothers. Male calves are confined in a crate that is barely bigger than them for 6 months where they are fed milk replacers, including cattle blood - they never get to drink milk from their mother.  Once the calves get to a certain size, usually in 6 months, they are slaughtered for veal. Their mothers, on the hand, is milked day in and day out by machines until they are dry and then they are re-impregnated. Once they are spent, they are then slaughtered for beef. Female calves end up with the same fate as their mother to be used as dairy cows. I just don't understand how someone who cares about animals can ignore the fact that cows suffer a great deal, just so we can have milk and cheese. It's not okay to me as a vegan and it shouldn't be okay to a vegetarian who proclaims to be a vegetarian mainly for animals. I hope this didn't come across as angry - it's more frustration and I'd really like to hear from your side how you justify using dairy in your recipes - is it just taste? Is it just that you don't feel you are contributing directly to the death of animals (although, this is definitely not true when you think about calves killed for veal).",

In order to do that, you would have to raise the cow and chicken yourself, take them to the vet if they get sick, and let them live out their lives naturally even when they are too old to produce milk or eggs. In essence, you have to treat them like your pet dog or cat. If you can do that, then sure you can call them humane eggs and milk. But to be honest, after going vegan and learning about eggs and milk - I find them pretty disgusting. Not to gross you out, but eggs are chicken's periods. We are the only species that drink a different species's milk beyond weaning - that seems very unnatural.",

I was diagnosed in July of 2011 with colon cancer that had spread to my liver.  I have been on chemo every other Wednesday since August of 2011.  I am now one treatment away from only having clinical trials left as options.  I started doing a lot of research on cancer and the vegetarian diet and decided to stop the chemo treatments.  I also started treatment with an acupuncturist, who immediately put me on a vegetarian - no dairy, no eggs - diet with vitamin and mineral supplements, plus some Eastern medicine.  She has had success in curing cancer for many patients in my area.  I grew up on a farm with my family of 7 and we always had a big garden and I knew where my meat came from because it was grown on our small farm.  But my acupuncturist guessed right off that I came from a family of farmers and she was right - 4 generations.  And now with me, 4 generations of colon cancer from my father's side.\n\nAs I said, for me the choice is to save my life and battle cancer, so I guess my reasons for becoming vegetarian are for health.  Only been at it for three weeks, but my husband (who has also joined me) and I are enjoying the food and feeling better by eating whole plant food.  Thank you for sharing why you became vegetarian - so sorry that some of the comments are not very kind.  You certainly weren't attacking anyone by stating your opinion so I don't understand where some of these nasty comments are coming from.  Good luck with your restaurant and please keep blogging.    :)",

However, the more information I gain about the benefits of eating this way, the more committed I have become and my consciousness has been raised about the environmental issues and animal cruelty that those who are vegetarian and vegan embrace.  Giving up meat and then eggs was surprisingly easy, but I have been hesitant to give up sour cream, cottage cheese, and cheeses until most recently - but still chiefly for health reasons.  Technically this makes my diet vegan, but I do not consider myself vegan and refuse to use that term to describe my diet or lifestyle.  Why?, because I do not hold the belief that eating animal or using animal products is wrong for everyone, and I will not judge nor want to be judged because I don't embrace the montra of veganism.  I have read attacks over and over from vegans on those who eat vegan or vegetarian but don't believe vegan.  I have scoured the internet for other nouns that quickly/easily sum up this lifestyle (thus how I found your website).  A new term that describes the plant-based lifestyle but does not encompass the total philosophy needs to be embraced.  Any suggestions?",

      "content": "Hello,\nThank you so much for raising this issue!  Yes, this is a personal choice for me and is very important to me.  Other people make other choices and I am fine with that and accept that. I have never tried to convince anyone to become vegetarian.  The hard part for me is that people seem to go dead brained when the issue of vegetarian comes up, and say things like....can't you just take out the meat and eat the vegetables?  Noooo....if it is cooked with meat or has meat in it, no.........I won't be eating it.  I live in the south and many vegetables are cooked with bacon, ham or the fat from these..........another no...no, for me!\nI am a great cook and so is my boyfriend and we love cooking vegetarian and finding new recipes to make.  I don't miss meat at all!  I have heard things like what do you eat, with the thought process, if there isn't any meat, it isn't a meal.\nRecently, I chose not to attend our club Christmas luncheon, because it was mostly meat and a friend of mine insisted on buying me a ticket, even after I told her I wasn't attending.  Would you believe that she did this as a gift for my birthday?  Sometimes, it is frustrating, but, because this is really a spiritual issue for me, I just have to let it go and know that I am doing what feels right for me.\nThanks for the opportunity to share.\nDenise",

You do know that birds naturally lay eggs and that hooved animals must be milked after they give birth if their baby isn't available don't you? And what gives you the right to judge others anyway? As long as Michael or anyone else is making sure their non-vegan foods are coming from cruelty free sources there is no problem.\n\nBy the way, I'll venture to bet that you own some type of possession that includes in whole or in part some sort of leather or feather(s).",

If one had these in their possession, it's very likely they were purchased before the knowledge of where such items came from. That said, the chickens used today for eggs were bred to make far more eggs than what nature ever intended. These white leghorn breeds lay about one egg every 28 hours - The original species that came from the jungle lay about one a month... Also please ask yourself what happens to the \"useless\" male chicks in hatcheries to get the answer as to whether industrial eggs are ever \"humane\".\n\nAnd yes, cows must be impregnated in order to start the lactating process. This is the milk that her calf would need to grow - But it's become the milk people \"desire\" to ingest instead. There's no necessity to drink cow's milk. In dairies the babies become \"unavailable\" so that humans may satisfy this want... Please ask yourself what happens to the \"unproductive\" male babies to get the answer as to whether dairy could ever be \"humane\".\n\nSorry, but there is no way to \"own\" and \"use\" another's life and still be ethical (humane) about it.",

You do know why the baby calves aren't \"available\", don't you? \nOr why they force cows to have one calf every year to right afterwards make them \"unavailable\" to them, or don't you? \nEver had a thought for male calves? \n\nAlso, do you know what happens to male baby chicks in the breeding of egg laying hens? \n\nIn both cases both industrial and organic is the same story. \n\nI don't judge anyone and don't  go into  threads like this to attack people, make your choices, that's fine, but do not tell yourself you are helping the animals and ridding them of things that they don't need. \nThere are no cruelty free sources, only slightly less cruel ones, please do some research.",

Mostly because I feel like we are equals to animals and it isn't humane to eat one another. I'm not very religios but I don't think that God meant for his own creation to consume another creation. I felt your words really mean something to me as I read them and I wanted to thank you. I am the only vegetarian in my family and I want to become a vegan. I told myself that I was going to wait until college because it would be too hard for my family to adjust to my new lifestyle but the more I think about it I want to change. Your website has really helped me so thanks :)",

      "content": "Whole foods plant based diet. But it's not a very helpful label. Most people's eyes glaze over before you get to plant. I've eaten this way for nine years now with a couple years of eggs and goat and sheep cheeses and yogurts. Cows milk makes my stomach ache. In the last few months, I've gone back to solely plant based, and I've been really trying to attend to the whole foods part of the equation and to create meals where more than half the meal is vegetable or fruit. \n\nThat was my original goal nine years ago, to eat more fruits and vegetables because I realized I didn't eat nearly the recommended amount based on any studies or recommendations. It's been hard for me to break the habit of planning meals around protein and to plan instead around available fresh produce though I've gotten infinitely more creative. I eat a much wider variety of foods now than before. It's always funny how people ask what can you eat because they think how I eat must be more restrictive. I can eat anything. I choose to eat a vast amount of different things that grow out of the ground.\n\nI love the non-judgmental, flexible attitude of your post and so many of the comments as well as the time you take to respond. I especially appreciate your focus on food as art and on ways of working with food to make our taste buds stand up and sing. \n\nI've found it difficult to use labels, especially vegan. I wear leather. I don't research my beauty care products. While I was motivated to eat more and a wider variety of fruits and vegetables for the health benefits, I became more aware of other benefits such as those to the environment and animal welfare, thankful that I wasn't ingesting those animals standing flank to flank in great mounds of their own feces you see along Interstate 5 in California. I thought about whether I could kill an animal, and if not, whether I am comfortable eating it. I can remember being horrified as a young girl catching a fish and thinking about the hook in the roof of its mouth and its suffocation. Could I shoot an animal? If it was looking at me? Would It die quickly?\n\nIt is so much about choice and what is right for each of us. I lived in Iceland for six months. It would be difficult and perhaps not environmentally responsible to eat a plant-based diet there. They grow so few things and almost everything in green houses. In California, it's easy for me to make this choice. Thanks for the blog. I'm looking forward to making the bibimbap without the egg for dinner tonight. I'm especially eager to try your tofu preparation.",

      "content": "Not to judge, criticize, nor even to challenge. Just some information. That's all. All facts are friendly.\nAnimal milk, and all dairy products produced from animal milk, depend upon pregnancy. Whether cow, goat, or sheep, milk production starts with calving, kidding, or lambing. For a couple of reasons, most of these offspring are destined for meat production. \n\nFirst, one half of all of these offspring are males. They cannot be employed to either replace dairy animals in a stable dairy herd, nor can they be employed to expand dairy production. Second, while the female offspring can be raised to produce milk, most will not. For stable dairy herds, only the number of offspring needed to replenish the normal annual herd mortality rate are retained. This is typically a fairly small fraction of the total of female offspring. And in expanding dairy herds, only a small number of carefully selected female offspring will be raised to adulthood. Expansions are carefully managed both in terms of number and in terms of genetics. The later often means recruiting genetic material from outside the herd's gene pool to improve genetic diversity and also to improve production.\n\nThe bottom line is that most dairy offspring will not be raised to adulthood. Most dairy herds are made up of animals that are the result of decades, if not centuries of selective breeding. While their genetics may make them excellent milk producers, they are often not suitable to be raised into adulthood for meat production. In most cases they are sold off into meat production as either veal calves, spring lambs, kids or pet food production. In some comparatively rare cases, dairy offspring are destroyed on site and disposed of. But most responsible, professionally operated dairies are built with a plan in place for selling offspring into the meat production marketplace.\n\nIn short, it is impossible to make cow's milk without making veal. Whenever we buy cow's milk, we are paying for the production of veal, whether we eat it, or not.\n\nIt is important to understand this and take this into consideration whenever you are making a decision about consuming dairy products. Where the milk comes from can have implications beyond just the treatment and husbandry of the milk producing animals. Competent, professional dairy farmers are happy to explain to anyone who asks how their dairy manages dairy offspring.",
