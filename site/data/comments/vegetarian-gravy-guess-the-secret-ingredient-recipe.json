(As you know) I'm a HUGE gravy fanatic - I have a couple gravy recipes using Marmite and they truly do have the best, most rich flavor of any of my gravies... but the addition of mushrooms sounds divine!! I'll check back and let you know how it fares among the non-vegetarians haunting my house this week!!!",

      "content": "Oh yeah, I never thought about how odd biscuits and gravy must sound to anyone from Europe, where biscuit means a cookie! A biscuit in America is somewhere between a croissant and a muffin, and they are hugely popular especially in the American South. They are raised with baking soda, and the butter is added with a pastry-style techique so they come out both tender and flaky.

      "content": "One of my very first, and most beloved, vegetarian cookbooks (by Rose Elliot, published in the late 1980's or early 1990's) taught me to use Marmite and mushrooms for really good gravy, and I frequently do a variation using both (but there are always onions and garlic included in the recipe). I would not dream of eating Marmite straight away on toast, however I also go into a mild panic when it runs out. It's a seasoning, people, not a food group! Luckily the behemoth chain grocery stores in my area carry it in their 'international' sections, so it is always available.",

All will work well in stock though :) I just bought a large tub of NZ marmite over to a friend in the US and she loves it. The problem is that most people assume that you eat it like Nutella. Start with a small amount on toast with butter and to make it even more palatable grill it on toast with cheese, you will love it in no time!",

      "content": "I often put Marmite in my gravy, but then I am in the UK where it is a widely available ingredient. I also frequently use it when making roast potatoes - it adds that savoury umami flavour that meat eaters get from roasting the meat in the same pan. My usual veggie roast potato recipe goes: parboil the potatoes until they are cooked at the edges but still crunchy in the middle, drain & add 2-3 tsp butter, 1\\2 tsp marmite & black pepper (maybe a little salt but you don't desperately need it as the butter & marmite both contain salt, and if you've boiled them in salted water or stock you definitely won't need extra salt), then shake them gently until they are well coated in the marmite & butter mixture. Transfer to a preheated roasting dish containing a little vegetable oil & roast until crispy (at least 40 mins).\n\nA tip for people who think they don't like Marmite: spread it REALLY thinly on buttered toast and you'll probably appreciate it a lot more - it is a bit overwhelming if you try to spread it thickly like other spreads! Give it another try as it's a really great source of B vitamins (better than Vegemite!).",

It's just that Americans have been confused by gigantic, leaden, packed with everything-but-the-kitchen-sink doorstops which are termed \"scones\" in coffee shops here. I first had scones while living in Johannesburg as a child-- they weren't even sweet, and I think that would be a shock to lots of Americans. I recall thinking they were biscuits-- and of course, they were!",
