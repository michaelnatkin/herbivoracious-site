      "content": "This food looks amazing and makes me totally miss Seattle. I'm from Portland and living in Washington D.C., which is an OK food town, but VERY pricey and there are precious few cool little restaurants like Noni's. Sigh. Thanks for the great posting! I will definitely try this place when I'm back in the area.",
