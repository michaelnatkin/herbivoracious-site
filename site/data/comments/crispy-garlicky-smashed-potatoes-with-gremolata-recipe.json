I'd advise sauteing the garlic in the oil, then spooning the oil over the potatoes while reserving the garlic, crisping, then topping with the sauteed garlic. After I scraped the burned garlic off my potatoes they were delicious though!",

But maybe you took the potatoes farther towards crispy than I did, which can be delicious as well - in which case I could see that burning garlic could be an issue. I like the garlic to turn into crisp bits, but not burned, for sure. In any event, thanks for the feedback!",
