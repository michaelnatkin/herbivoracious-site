      "content": "Every time I go to Israel, Abulafia is on my first place to go list. I just love to eat the delicious bread they prepare since 18th century. When you buy a lot of stuff from there, the man in charge gives you for free some of the bread you did not take. That's what I call \"client service\". Does somebody remember the name of the place where you can buy arab yogurt that is warm, they also sell ice cream, corn, it\u00b4s close to Abulafia.\nThanks",

I didn't know Abulafia from Adam.\nAt the time, I was part of the US team that was introducing McDonald's to Israel.  I introduced za'atar Pita to my colleagues and they were in heaven.\nAbulafia knows how to make delicious baked products that are hot fresh, and delicious.\nMore power to him.",
