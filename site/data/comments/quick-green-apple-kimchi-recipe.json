      "content": "Michael, apple kimchi is marvelous! I love any kimchi, and I don't think I tried any that I didn't, including apple one. At some point I was working for a private company in Lynnwood with five Korean ladies in the office. I wish I asked them more questions, but I was busy trying all different food they shared for lunch. \nMichael, I have non-post related question, I hope you don't mind. I am looking into tofu, and there is such a huge controversy around the soy products, and it's effect on our bodies. What do you think of that? I am 95% vegetarian (I eat fish occasionally), but I still don't use any  soy products, including tofu. Although I do love tofu, even raw. Thanks for your feedback, Michael! :)",

      "content": "Hey Marina - well, I'm definitely no expert on health stuff. I figure tofu has been a major food in Asia for a thousand years, so it is probably fine, at least as part of a balanced diet containing a wide variety of real food. I'm more skeptical of highly processed soy protein isolate stuff; I try to keep my intake of those kinds of things pretty low.",

      "content": "I think in Korea it isn't considered a kimchi unless fermented( i could be wrong), but usually we call it a muchim. The apple \"kimchi\" looks very good, in korea they do something similar with asian pears, and it is delicious. never thought to do it with apples, but I will now, thank you. The sweet salty and spicy combo is one of my favourite combinations. Thank you for posting, and I love your website.",
