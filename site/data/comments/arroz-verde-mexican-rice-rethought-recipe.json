      "content": "Hey!  I use this trick when I make Peruvian arroz con pollo!  :)  Except, I don't boil the chicken and rice together.  I know purists would shake their heads in disdain but I found that I like to cook my rice in the rice cooker (with vegetable or chicken broth) and then mix in pureed cilantro afterwards.  That way I don't end up with a scorched pot of burnt rice stuck to the bottom and the rice always turns out a beautiful green.",

      "content": "Michael, I love this idea - I just did something like it with a bit of chicken soup I made - I took fresh parlsley, garlic chive, nettle (blanced) and tarragon from the kitchen garden, minced the herbs, chopped the nettle, and added them on top of the soup in each bowl. The smiles on our guests' faces were all I needed to see. . .\n\nAs for the rice - I've made this before, I think it's important to rinse the dickens out of it, then fry it lightly \"until it dances\" in the pan. To me, it provides a more satisfying, authentic flavor, but I love the simplicity of this recipe!\n\nCheers\n\n-Jeff",
