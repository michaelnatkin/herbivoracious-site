I've been working on some Bayless cookbooks, and he seems to recommend salting at the end of his sauces and beans (and I appreciate his size suggestions--I think I usually undersalt).\n\nLike the idea of your series.",

Thanks for the motivation.\n\nI have been using sea salt from the bulk bin at the local food co-op for my daily cooking, but it's not iodized. Do you ever used iodized salt? I wonder if the nutritional concerns that initially lead to ionization are still existent in the modern diet.\n\nOh, and you forgot one of the other basic food groups- garlic ;)",

That in many 'developed' countries people taste buds are either underdeveloped or have been killed. More people are using ready made food, or half made (sauces from sachets, mixes, those kind of things) which already contain sodium (sometime to much in fact) and other flavor enhancers. Salt is vital in our diet, we need it. Too much salt, and we die. But it is not the home cook, who makes everything from scratch and add his/her own salt who is at risk here! It is the one who buy ready made food, sauces, mixes, cans and packets...add the sodium that you see in the labels and see you blood pressure rise!  If these people stop buying food, and learn to cook from scratch, they will also learn to use salt :-).",

Knowing about foods, their natural qualities, and nutritional content can really make a difference in the use of salt. At least it does for me.\n\nI am a person who has cooked low salt for the last 40+ years by choice. I always warn guests I use minimal salt, they frequently don't add any additional salt, although it is freely available, telling me my cooking doesn't need it.\n\nThat being said, I realize certain foods demand salt, such as mashed potatoes, and don't hesitate to use it when called for. I use a Himalayan mined pink salt for everyday, and love alder smoked salt. I will definitelt check out the Meadow.",

I also like the analysis of salt, acid, fat and crunch: I've become a big believer in a drizzle of sherry vinegar or a sprinkling of Maldon on a finished dish.  Would spice also fit into this model?  A little cayenne, Tabasco or Sriracha goes a long way towards lifting flavors.  Perhaps professional chefs wouldn't include spice in the same way because different customers have different heat preferences?",

(One thing they often say is that they never salt nor sweeten any foods so that their children will not have 'bad habits' to break when they're adults. SMH!) HOWEVER...when it comes to unsalted butter, I MUST disagree with you. I buy only 'hand crafted, organic' butter from a woman at our local farmers market...her butter is even better than the imported Irish butter. I would never add salt to that. I serve it with my own homemade bread, and totally enjoy the sweet, creamy flavour of that butter, just 'as is'. The bit of salt in the bread is all that is needed. Please, try a really great butter WITHOUT the salt, and see if you don't agree.",

I DO salt the greens while sauteing, depending on what else will be in the filling.)",
