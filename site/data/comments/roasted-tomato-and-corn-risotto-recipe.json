Yeah, I wouldn't probably use perfect $6/lb heirlooms for roasting -\nthis is more of the place to use the #2s they might be selling for cheap, or\nsome that a neighbor gives you that are a little underripe - a fantastic way\nto take some tomatoes that are a bit less than perfect and turn them into a\ntrue treat.",
