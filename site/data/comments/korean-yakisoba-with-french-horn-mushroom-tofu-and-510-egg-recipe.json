      "content": "Looks great. By the way, garlic chives are even easier to grow than regular chives. You start by taking a head of garlic from the grocery, breaking it into cloves, filling a small pot with dirt, and shoving each clove into the dirt about an inch deep so that its \"rough\" (i.e. less pointed) end is down. Add some water; wait a while. Soon (i.e., a few weeks) you'll have garlic chives.",

You'll see yakisoba on the menu if you go to an izakaya in Korea, and yakisoba is a pretty common find at Korean pubs as well.\n\nThanks for the recipe! It's a different take on my fallback meal--noodles with kimchi, tofu, and scallions.",

      "content": "Hey there!\nI'm not actually sure the exact dish like yakisoba exists in Korea. Of course there are many different noodle dishes but this yakisoba seems like a fusion, but I must say, a great one!\n\nMy mum makes me this cold noodle for a midnight snack when I'm back home in Korea. She boils Somen, rinses them cold. Then she mixes chopped kimchi with sesame, a bit of sugar, more chilli of you would like, a bit of soysauce, spring onion, and a spoonful or two of the kimchi juice. This mixture is mixed with noodle with an ice cube or two (if it's a very hot day) and a boiled egg on top. Voila! Midnight kimchi noodle!\nI also like simple gochujang sauce with the noodle too. (gochujang, vinegar, sugar, more chilli if you can take the heat, sesame seeds..). This goes well with julienned cucumber and a boiled egg. This is called Bibim-Guksu.\nHave fun on tour, and thanks for your great blog!",

      "content": "Your friendly gardening geek here:  @ John - that's garlic *greens* or leaves you're talking about - yes, very easy to grow and useful in the kitchen as well as a pest repellent, but not chives.\nRegular chives are \"allium schoenoprasum\" and garlic chives are \"allium tuberosum\" - both look rather grasslike, with much narrower leaves and milder flavor than, respectively, onions or garlic.\nI don't use garlic or hot peppers in cooking as my husband can't digest either (I just grow them as pest repellent) - buckwheat noodles with mushrooms sounds really good, though; I think I'll add some kind of greens and do this for supper.",

I'm copy/pasting several of them to my recipe file, and know I'll be back soon for more. My mouth is watering right now. I will be making a glazed tofu tonight, and use your plate suggestions to add brown rice and broccoli along with the sesame seed condiment. YUM. Luckily it won't take very long to make. I am STARVING. So, I am SO happy I found you. I forsee a LOT of good eating in my future.",
