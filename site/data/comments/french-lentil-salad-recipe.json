      "content": "this recipe was fantastic! we paired it with some homegrown corn (we're southern folk!) and everyone loved it. we're foster parents and even our 5 yr-old foster daughter who was raised to be a hardcore meat-eater ate every last bite. :o) it's b/c of recipes like this that we're able to influence our children's healthy eating habits and introduce them to a variety of foods. p.s. -- i never would have thought of including cucumbers -- genius!!",
