Each bite is tasty and you need very little (if any) dressing. You'll eat your daily quota of vegetables easily and, because the more variety of vegies you use the more color you'll have, the healthier the salad will be.",

      "content": "We eat this kind of salad every day. When it's the main course for dinner, which it often is, we do the following: lots of different vegetables (cucumber, peppers, radish, tomato, lettuce, red cabbage, etc.), finely chopped fresh hot pepper (the green kind, I don't know what it's called in English, maybe it's a fresh jalapeno), pomegranate seeds, green pumpkin seeds, dried cranberries, and sprouted beans (usually mung because they're always around). If we have a few extra minutes, we throw in a grain, like cooked bulgur wheat. Dressing is just lemon juice, olive oil, and kosher salt. Just before serving, a drizzle of raw tahini over the top.",
