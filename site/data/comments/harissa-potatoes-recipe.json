      "content": "Michael, do you ever make your own harissa? I make mine every few months, and it keeps well in a jar in the refrigerator, especially if I put a little layer of olive oil over the top. Plus it's dirt-cheap to make if you keep a few spices and dried peppers in the house.",

      "content": "I figure that the harissa is so packed with chiles, olive oil, and salt that bacteria wouldn't really stand a chance! I've never had trouble with it going bad or making anyone sick. \n\nYou can also make it in fairly small amounts - I think my recipe makes about half a cup at most, so it's not like it's going to sit around for years (especially given how much my husband and I love North African food).",
