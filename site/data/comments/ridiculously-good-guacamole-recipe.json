We don't grow a lot of avocados in Rhode Island. :(\n\nThe \"stick the point of the knife into the seed\" approach to removing the pit risks bending the knife-point if your avocado's a little unripe. Instead, I cut into the seed with the sharp edge of the knife, sort of like a logger sticking an axe into the stump of a tree. Having done so, I then twist the knife a bit to free up the seed from the avocado half.\n\nI agree completely about the difference between California and Hass avocados, by the way.",

There is much more detail to making \"the best\" guacamole than the majority of lazy online recipes you come across on the web.\n\nNEVER GARLIC! - ALWAYS FRESH HOT CHILES!\n\n1) SOAK THE MINCED ONION IN WARM SALT WATER FOR 5-10 MINUTES TO REDUCE THE RAW HARSHNESS. RINSE AND DRAIN.\n2) MINCE THE CHILE VERY FINE. MINCE THE ONION SLIGHTLY LESS FINE. CHOP THE CILANTRO. MAKE A COUPLE TABLESPOONS OF CHILE PASTE (CHILE, CILANTRO, ONION AND SALT)\n3) MIX THE PASTE IN WITH THE ROUGHLY MASHED AVOCADO. ADD ONLY ABOUT 1/2 JUICED LIME FOR EVERY 3 AVOCADOS).\n4) INCORPORATE A LITTLE MORE MINCED CHILE AND ONION, CHOPPED CILANTRO AND DICED TOMATO. SEASON TO TASTE WITH MORE SALT OR LIME JUICE IF NEEDED. GARNISH WITH SOME SEASONED DICED TOMATO ON TOP.\n5) TO STORE: PRESS PLASTIC WRAP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GUACAMOLE AND LEAVE AN AVOCADO SEED IN THE CONTAINER. IT WILL KEEP FOR 2 DAYS.",

To get the right amount of spicy (I'd say medium) 1 serrano pepper to 3 avocados is good, but put a little in at a time so you get it just right. Also, I chop the serrano as finely as possible.",
