      "content": "Update: I made these again tonight, so I could take a batch to my crue at work before the big leave of absence starts. This time I used demerera sugar. The larger grains gave them even more sandiness, but I think I prefer the original. I find that in my oven at 330 F, 10 minutes instead of 12 is perfect. Also, I didn't have 3 hours to refrigerate them, so I did an hour in the freezer instead and that worked just fine.",
