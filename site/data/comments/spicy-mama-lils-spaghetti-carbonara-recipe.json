      "content": "Michael, thank you for this recipe!  I usually have most of the ingredients on hand, so this is a perfect pantry-staple weeknight dinner. I often use Mama Lil's to garnish kale salad, and my boyfriend likes to fry them up with field roast sausage to punch up basic spaghetti with tomato sauce. \n\nI made your carbonara this week ... I only had about 1/4 cup of the mild peppers on hand, so I made up the other 1/4 cup with the kick-butt variety. The dish ended up quite spicy, as you predicted, but I was actually surprised how much the creaminess of the eggs and cheese cut through the spice. Will definitely be making this one again.",
