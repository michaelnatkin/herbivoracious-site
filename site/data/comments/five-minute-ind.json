      "content": "I came across this recipe looking for a way to use mustard seeds in an indian-inspired cabbage dish. I served it with potato-cauliflower curry and it was fantastic! I added a fresh chile, garlic, upped the cayenne by almost double and then added lemon and cilantro, both of which I found were important to the dish for my taste.\n\nThanks for the recipe, I'll surely make it again and browse the rest of the recipes on your site.",

      "content": "I found this recipe unsatisfactory, but for silly reasons, I think: the cabbage I got was too large (perhaps 8\" diameter), and the largest burner on my stove is too small, maybe. Anyhow, stir-frying the cabbage was really not working, so at some point I gave up and added a few oz of water and covered the wok and stemed things so as to get the cabbage a BIT cooked. Then, when the water boiled off, I stirred a bit more to make sure everything was oil-coated, and served it. It was oddly taste-less; the mustard-oil flavor was weak, and the spice-flavors all but disappeared. I suspect that with a 5\" diameter cabbage (which is only about 1/4 the volume of an 8\" one), the flavors would be stronger, and the cooking might go better. I'll certainly give it another try, because the ingredient combination seems like a winner.\n\nOne last suggestion: \"sliced thin\" is a little vague. That could be 1/16\" or 1/4\", whcih is a pretty wide range of variation. Maybe you should add a suggested thin-ness (or say that it doesn't matter).",

      "content": "I tried it again, and liked it lots more. I think I must have been tired or just screwed up the last time. This time around, I went with half of the half-cabbage that was left (i.e., one quarter of an 8\" cabbage), and the flavors were much clearer, and the cabbage-cooking went better. I still had to add a bit of canola oil (I used pure mustard oil, and there just wasn't quite enough there during the stir-frying. I cut down the cayenne to just a sprinkle (I've got a kid who doesn't like hot food) and the salt by half because I tend to be salt-averse, but next time I'd go ahead and use 3/4tsp.\n\nAnyhow, this time around it got generally good reviews. I'll probably try it once more, with that last 1/4-cabbage.",
