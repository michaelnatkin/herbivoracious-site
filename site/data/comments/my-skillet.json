The problem is, I love it so much in the kitchen that I don't want to pack it! And now it lives full-time in the oven, ready for another loaf of no-knead! =)",

Also, I will take your advice and get a metal spatula.\n\nI have a 10-inch inheritance that I am just getting around to seasoning.  Can you believe I used to steam vegetables with it?  The bamboo steamer fit on top of it perfectly.  Needless to say, it had a few layers of rust.  I didn't understand the glory of the skillet back then so it sat for a year or two in the back of the cupboard. I just rubbed it down with sandpaper the other day and now I think it will be fine.  It's  a lot lighter than the Lodge so I may end up using it more.",

      "content": "The whole \"distributes heat evenly\" stuff is, of course, a crock, as you point out. The heat equation applies, even if the pot came from your grandma. :)\n\nBut the good news is that the heat equation is your friend: if you want a nearly uniformly hot skillet (or \"more nearly uniformly hot than you'll get with anything else\"), you can do wonders with cast iron. One trick is to heat it over a low-to-moderate heat, and keep moving it around on the burner. The good news is that the already-hot bits will lose heat in proportion to their surface area and the coolness of adjacent bits, but will RETAIN heat in proportion to their (thermal) mass, which is large. That means that by preheating different bits sequentially, you can get a pretty uniformly hot skillet. Yay!\n\nWe have about 4 nesting skillets, and the big one stays on the stove at all times. Some of them have very smooth bottoms, and others have not-so-smooth bottom surfaces. I keep wanting to take one of these to the machine shop at work and just run an end-mill over it to try to smooth it out (perhaps using canola oil rather than cutting oil as the lubricant). Has anyone ever tried this? Or am I better off just paying for a new 8\" pan? I might do it just for the delight of seeing the guys in the machine shop stare at me. :)",

To keep my wife happy, I borrowed a glass lid from another pan to hide the \"dirt\" (she prefers the kitchen to be spotless) and keep the dust off of the cooking surface.  No other pan is as versatile, and I think that I'd rate mine as the #1 \"must have\" tool for any kitchen (even above a good knife).\n\nI've heard rumors about highly acidic foods damaging the patina/season of cast iron cookware, but I haven't had any trouble with it, and I still think it's the best pan for my wife's balsamic mustard greens.",

      "content": "Cast iron skillets are amazing. I can't imagine making good cornbread without one. My 10 inch doesn't live on my stove, but it's certainly my favorite for certain dishes.\n\nI used to have a 12 inch, as well, but I never really liked it. I could never get it properly seasoned for some reason. I broke it, believe it or not. I suspect there was a flaw in the casting.  I left it on a hot burner by accident. I heard a huge pop, turned around, and there it was, cracked right in half. It's one of the weirdest things I've seen in the kitchen.\n\nJohn, (What a great name.) ;-)\nI don't know that I'd bother trying to smooth out the bottom surface. The roughness is an artifact of the casting process. I doubt it would help even out the heat distribution. If you're worried it's scratching the inner seasoned surface of the other pans, do what you should be doing anyway. Put a paper plate or something like that in between them when stacking.",

I also have a 5 or 6\" (never measured it, its not lodge though) that I use just as often to toast chiles and onions in for salsas, carmelize toppings like leeks or onions or just fry up eggs on saturday mornings.  Finally I have my huge dutch oven with legs.  That thing is so effin heavy, but nothing compares when you want a good stew.  I've contemplated buying a power saw to cut those damn obtrusive legs off though!\n\nThe only other things I need are my knives. I can't live without my knifes.

I guess its not that bad cuz it hasn't stopped me from making my lemon-garlic chicken.  But, you're not supposed to use soap in it, EVER.  So I'm told anyway.  I use salt to clean it... and very hot water.  If something gets stuck on I'll boil a little water in it. If foods starts to stick I'll re-grease it and bake for an hour.  Works everytime.  Another trick to not stick, make sure whatever you're cooking isn't too cold. ;o)",

I have since added a 4\" for single serving/small jobs, and a beautiful 2-burner grill/griddle piece I got for $0.50 at a garage sale.  I didn't really buy the hype that tomato sauces and cast iron didn't mix, until all the seasoning from my pan went bye-bye after a few meals of spaghetti.  We made a huge batch of homemade marinara from our tomato garden this year, and I figure all my other cast iron meals are so yummy, why not right?  Wrong.  I was almost heart-broken when I saw that silver after getting so used to the lovely black.  But, ce la vie!  It gives me the excuse to cook that much more and reseason my pan again and again.",

I tend to use Spectrum High Heat Safflower Oil as my generic neutral oil, so that gets wiped on the pan for seasoning as well. Works fine, with no stickiness at all.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

Then again I guess that's true of any implement you spend years with. One thing that I'm not too sure about is the even heating, some say it's really even, others like yourself notice hotspots... Is this just down to the nature of the pan? Or is this down to the date and style of manufacture? I only ask because I'm looking to buy my own.\n\nThanks for sharing!\nJohn.",

Pretreated skillets are made that way with particularly noxious chemicals (the kind you might imagine it would take to render iron forever non-stick).\n\nALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:\n\nI bought mine used on ebay from some diner in tennessee. cheap. treated. great.

I lived on a small boat (alone) on the Brisbane River for two years and cooked most of my meals in that skillet, over a metho (methylated spirits) burner. Later I found a camp oven with a lid that also fits the skillet. I'm now exploring Far North Queensland, a little old lady :) solo in a campervan and again, the skillet is fine for most meals. Re another favourite utensil, it's a pair of Asian poultry shears bought cheap at a Vietnamese shop. With huge handles and an obviously handcrafted look, they get used for everything but cutting poultry. They hang beside my late mother's zester, the ancestral nut cracker, and an antique nutmeg grater complete with niche for nutmeg.",

I saw my German friend's iron pan in action some years ago, and was amazed by its being completely non-stick without any chemical coatings. I looked everywhere for iron pans because they are lighter than cast iron pans but otherwise have all the same qualities it seems, and needs to be treated and seasoned just the same.    I first saw de Buyer pans in a market in Copenhagen where they are sold to professional cooks, but they were out of the smaller sizes I needed, so I was very excited to find a nice selection at Williams Sonoma in the U. village in Seattle.  I now have two, and one of them is quite small and perfect as a second pan.  No more throwing $60-$80 dollar teflon etc. pans out every couple of years because we yet again managed to destroy their non-stick coating with excessive heat or the wrong utensils.",

      "content": "Definitely agree with everyone here about the wonders of a good cast-iron skillet. I use mine for everything (except for dishes that have a lot of volume, like a big bunch of Swiss chard). I never had a problem with acidic foods (I do use it for pan sauces with tomatoes or citrus) or with the poor distribution of heat - I just move the pan around a bit on the burner. However, I'm pretty lazy about caring for it: I wash it with soap and I don't oil it every day. But still, it treats me just fine.\n\nOther loves:\n\nI'm glad that someone mentioned their affection for their wooden spoons. I have two that are darkened, nicked, burnt in spots, and I use them nonstop. Recently I've been using tongs a lot more, much more than a spatula. I never found a spatula that I really bonded with, and I tend to break them.\n\nAbout a year ago, I bought a really nice ceramic pie dish for my wife, who likes to bake. She doesn't use it that much - I commandeered it for roasting small amounts of vegetables, quiches, and things like Mark Bittman's awesome Autumn Millet Bake (http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/mark-bittmans-autumn-millet-bake-recipe.html).\n\nFinally, I have a lot of affection for my wooden chopping block, which takes up a lot of space but a big chopping block is pretty essential when you are cutting lots of vegetables all the time. \n\nBy the way: great blog, Michael!",

I read a recipe from somewhere that if you want a crispy tofu, freeze tofu, and defrost, remove the water with paper towels, then fry it in a very hot pan.  The problem was that my regular frying pan was not hot enough to make tofu crispy.  It came out not crispy.  I've tried so many times, but every time it came out not crispy.\n\nI have a cast iron skillet for many years in closet, and I used to  use it to make pancakes.  I  even learned how to season it very good using flex seed oil.   I don't eat pancakes anymore, so I've forgotten about it.   I'm going to use it to fry tofu this weekend.  \n\nMyong",
