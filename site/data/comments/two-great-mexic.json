      "content": "It is really i mpressive when Mexican cookbooks are vegan, like \"Vegan Taste of Mexico\" by Linda Majzlik or \"Viva Vegan!\" by Terry Hope Romero.  Authentic mexican food can be vegan as shown by the restaurant Gracias Madre in San Francisco's Mission district.  Cheese is far from good for either the environment and both massively shortens a cow's life (killed at 5 years vs living to 20+) and the constant pregnancy feeds both veal and beef.",

      "content": "I am finally becoming interested in vegetarian/vegan cooking.  Yesterday i went to a Whole Foods near us, and with the help of friendly staff, located some of the very unfamiliar ingredients I was looking for,  The young woman who helped me told me to check out your website, so I did, and look forward to browsing through your recipes for healthy and cost-effective ideas.  Many thanks.",
