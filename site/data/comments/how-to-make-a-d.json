I may make a version of this though because it has all the flavours I love. I wonder about a wee bit of fresh oregano... just a speck.",

I used french feta, which is creamier and dissolved into pure heaven.  I topped with some fresh pea sprouts, and it was a perfect lunch on a hot day.  Thanks!",

      "content": "This was  big hit at last night's potluck. I added half a small jar of sundried tomatoes in oil, chopped up, and some fresh parsley, because I had it growing outside. At first I thought \"hunh...not as tasty or well-blended as I expected.\" Then my wife pointed out that I'd failed to add the feta. After that, it improved a lot. I might salt and drain the cukes for a little while if I made it again -- after an hour's sitting around, it was getting kind of soupy/watery at the bottom of the bowl. Of course, that'd kind of mess up the \"5 minute salad\" thing. Speaking of which, you obviously chop stuff a lot faster than I do -- this took somewhat longer than 5 minutes for me to throw together. :)",
