      "content": "I have not made this dish but I can tell you how long it would take to cook dried , soaked flat favas or marrowfat beans in the pressure cooker. My best estimate is that they would take between 6 and 8 minutes at pressure. I would add 3/4 to 1 cup water for each cup of dried beans that have been soaked. It most likely be about 2 1/2 cups water total to cook.\n\nIf you ever want to know more about pressure cooking, I am your go-to person. I have been teaching pressure cooking for more than 17 years. All the info is also in my book The New Fast Food which has all pressure cooking recipes.\n\nI love cooking beans. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

      "content": "Jill, thanks for posting pressure cooking instructions for flat favas and marrowfat beans. I think Michael\u2019s recipe looks and sounds delicious. I\u2019m eager to try it using a pressure cooker. \n\nI also want to second what Jill said about her being a go-to person for info about pressure cooking. She definitely is my go-to pressure cooking expert.  I own more than 50 pressure cooking cookbooks and I refer to Jill\u2019s more often than any I own. Her recipes are wonderful and it\u2019s a great reference as well. \n\nMichael\u2019s Herbivoracious (which I also own) and Jill Nussinow\u2019s The New Fast Food are two books that are well-worth owning.",

      "content": "Hi I finally learned the English word for kapucijner. Literally translated it wou like d mean Capuchin like the monks. What interest me is the fact you say they are brown whereas here in Holland they are definitely grey-green.  Rarely eaten in soup but cooked and then doused with rendered smoked pork fat and eaten with chopped gherkins, fried and chopped  raw onions, picallilly and the crispy pork rins, the whole is called a  captain's dinner. Definitely winter food!\nHowever when you say soup my thoughts turn to a hearty brown bean version of the traditiional pea soup but NOT vegetarian and a whole different ball game altogether. Having said all this I'm going for your recipe it looks grest:-)",

      "content": "Believe me, I have never had them served in holland looking so appealing. This is usually served as a side dish made with with bacon, onions and other vegetables to make the menu sound more sophisticated, as many people don't know what kapucijners are. Well they also don't know how to make good cappuccinos but that's another story!",
