      "content": "Nice! I have a bun habit, too. In fact, I go to the same place so often that the proprietor finally sat down to inform me that I was using the \"wrong\" table condiment. Apparently the Sriacha paste (in the bottle with the rooster on it) is not vinegary enough. He directed me to the Sambal Olek-like chili vinegar stuff in the little jar on the table. Sho-enough, it made the bun so much better. Thanks for the recipe, I'll have to try this on Mr. Tofu when a craving hits!",

I find the slightly sweet, fruity flavor works well - it doesn&#39;t taste at all the same as nuoc mam of course, but to me it tastes really good.",
