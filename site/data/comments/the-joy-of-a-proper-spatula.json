      "content": "I have that very spatula, and although it's very useful, I wish I'd gotten one with a plastic or impregnated rather than a wooden handle.  It's fussy to clean because you can't just set it down into a pan of water to soak, but have to make sure that the handle stays dry. Repeated swelling and shrinking of wood will greatly shorten its working life.",

When I do use it itch non-stick, I am very careful.  But I'd love to know if you've a non metal version.  \n\nI'm just discovering your blog after seeing you on KCTS Cooks/sides.  I love Brussels  sprouts nd hope I'll find the recipes here.\n\nThanks for a great website!\nMichelle",

      "content": "Hey Michelle - for non-stick, you really can't use metal implements. I like silicone spatulas like this: https://herbivoracious.com/heatproof-silicone-spatulas for use in non-sticks, but of course they don't have thin leading edges for flipping. I've got some thin plastic spatulas for flipping but I can't say I love any of them.",
