We made it a lot with sauteed onions and mixed it with pasta and sour cream (I know it sounds vile, but it was good!). This looks tremendous -- and I like the apple element.",

      "content": "Hi Kathy - the difference is that the cider balsamic is quite thick and sweet. So what you might be able to is reduce the cider vinegar with some sugar until syrupy. If you happen to have apple butter, add some of that and strain the result, that might be kinda close.\n\nMichael",

      "content": "Michael -- Your response comes as I lick the last sauce off the plate. My inclinations were good! I added 2T of balsamic vinegar, 1/4 C of good quality cider vinegar, and a T of sugar. Cringed when considering 8 T of butter in the sauce alone so I cut back to six. I also substituted a great cognac for the Calvados (I'm upstairs and all these bottles are downstairs; I don't pay as close attention to the producers as others). But what a fantastic dish! Next time I'll be prepared and take it over the top. Thanks!",
