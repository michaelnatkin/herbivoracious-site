Or to go a another way, add 1 cup of tomato puree, which will give you the acid and flavor depth, but a somewhat different dish.",

I&#39;ve found it to be good, but not *as* good as the best commercial ricotta I know (Calabro, or for those in Seattle, the store-made stuff at DeLaurenti). It is however *much* better than typical grocery store ricotta, which I find to be grainy and lacking in the pure dairy sweetness of the good stuff.",
