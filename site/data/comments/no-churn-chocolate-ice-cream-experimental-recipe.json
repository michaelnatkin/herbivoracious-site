I'd like to see how this would work with a non-dairy coconut milk base, though by the time I have time to work out a formula and try it, I'll probably (hopefully) be able to eat dairy again.  I'll let you know if I have any luck.",

      "content": "Oh, right, add that to the list of questions! I think the answer will be, it should work fine as long as you add calcium as needed. The Pomona brand pectin comes with a little package of calcium that you can mix in when there isn&#39;t any already present. The only challenge will be to work out the right amount. This should be great with a coconut-milk base.",

Unfortunately, the solubility of most gasses goes UP as the temperature goes down, so there's no obvious way to get bubble to form \"as it freezes.\" Maybe that's why they invented the ice-cream mixer. :(",

Might add too much air though. CO2 would likely leave it somewhat carbonated even after frozen? Not positive. That might be interesting too :).",

I kind of like that, but I still want to look into how low I can go with the pectin, for cases where I don&#39;t want that feel. It also has essentially no air beaten in, so in that respect it is like a super-premium ice cream. The flavor is very concentrated.",
