Poggi kimchi is stuffed with all the spices, and normally doesn't use anchovie. It is sold at large korean grocery stores.",

I used to think that as well (that traditionally all kimchi has shrimp or fish sauce), but it turns out that that is an overly narrow view. In Korea, there are literally hundreds of varieties, and while many of them aren&#39;t vegan, there are several that are. So it is just a matter of finding a good Korean (or general Asian) grocer and looking at all the labels.",

      "content": "Hey, this was great. Everyone loved it, and it was pretty simple (although a bit of a messy-kitchen kind of meal: there was a fair amount of oil-splatter during the cooking, as expected). I made two batches, but with only 1c of kimchi between them, since some of my family is spicy-averse. I shouldn't have worried -- a full 3/4 c in each batch would have been OK. Perhaps the kimchee I bought was a little mild. My only other thought is that I might choose to double the green onions, but that's just because I really like those. I think this is the kind of recipe where exact amounts aren't critical.\n\nHint for those in the frozen north (or northeast): No old rice in the fridge? You can cook some rice in your steamer, or microwave, or whatever, spread it 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick on a platter, and shove it outside in clear, dry, 10-degree weather and have 'day old cold rice' about 20 minutes later. I'm not sure whether this is a good or bad. :(",

      "content": "I always fry kimchi first so that it has time to cook through. When cooked, kimchi (especially sour one) acquires different layers of flavor. Also kimchibokkuembap is best with slightly undercook rice. If your rice is wet, it tends to get mushy in this dish. If you have sour kimchi in your frig and don't know what to do, try kimchi soup too. My all time favorite hearty, warming, satisfying cold weather meal! Little bit of dried anchovies (2-3 large ones) and two cups of kimchi with its juice and water is all you need. For protein, I add tofu or a can of tuna (in olive oil, not water). Boil it first and simmer for about 10-15 minutes in low heat. Voila, delish!",
