      "content": "Happy birthday to your daughter Michael!\n\nIn regard to the name Herbivoracius, my first impression of it was that is was mostly a 'fun' name, like some non-vegetarians often call vegetarians/vegan and anyone who eats a little bit different...I have been called herbivore, brown bread, little bird, rabbit...all sort of names. I don't get offended, and I often use them myself to make myself understood (to some people - mostly those who say \"here is the normal food and on this side the rabbit food...' these people need a fun approach or they can put you down!).\n\nOf course I am not a 'herbivore', rabbit, little bird or a slice of brown bread! My diet is larger that that.\n\nBut certainly I would not use the word omnivore as I don't eat fish and meat.\n\nAlso herbivores eat a variety of insects with their grass, so they are less vegetarian than me!\n\nWhat do you think?",

At any rate this is the only negative comment I've received about it in almost 2 years of running the blog.",
