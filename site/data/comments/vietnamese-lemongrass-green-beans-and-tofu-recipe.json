I made it with a brown rice version of the coconut rice  (which I baked ala Alton Brown), it was so good!\n\nI am a new vegetarian; have been eating vegetarian meals but have recently cut out all meat and need all the help I can get with tofu. For the longest time I have been having difficulty browning it. Your tip to have it on the highest heat possible gave me the brilliant idea to use my cast iron pan (which is by far my favorite) and it worked out really awesome! Thanks!",

      "content": "Hey Jigna - for the lemongrass, you should feel free to use more stalks of it if you want to amp up the flavor. Be sure to bruise it really well and mince it fine, as that is what releases the aromatic compounds. For coconut milk, I like any of the Thai brands. They will all have a preservative (usually sodium benzoate), but I avoid ones with any thickeners. I do prefer full fat myself, but the low fat can be ok.",
