You have to try and look at them with fresh eyes as something with an intense, complex, fruity, tart and slightly sweet flavor that has a broader range of uses.",

I'll admit I'm still a little on the fence when it comes to the raisins but maybe I will give it a go.\n\nAnd I can't wait for your book!!",

I remember a similar pasta from the New York Times some years ago (which has now become a family favorite)- pinenuts, chopped parsley, raisins, olive oil, and flaked roast chicken brushed with smoked paprika- somehow the raisins always add to the balance of the dish. Using cauliflower instead makes the meal healthier and cheaper without any loss of flavour.",

It was very good and a nice change from the tomato based sauces that tend to be the pasta fall back position.  I used golden raisins, and as I ate it, I kind of wished for a squeeze of lemon along with the orange, but it was good enough that I didn't bother to get up to go to the kitchen and get the lemon :) Thanks for another great recipe!",

My only suggested change was that next time, I might go with smaller pieces of cauliflower, to allow a little more browing, and maybe slightly better mixing. We all really wanted to take bites that had a bit of everything, but the large cauliflower bits made that more difficult.",

Generally with a thinner sauce you want something with nooks and crannies to hold onto it. This particular dish is pretty sauceless, so not a crucial concern. I think angel hair might feel too delicate with the big chunks of cauliflower; penne sounds good to me. But don't be afraid to experiment with any shape you like!",

I did have a minor problem, though, with the sliced garlic, which stayed on the bottom of the pan throughout and got dark brown very quickly--by the time the cauliflower was done the garlic was close to being burned and getting a little bitter. I used a cast iron skillet because it's so good for browning, was it maybe a little too good?  I don't see from the comments that anyone else had this problem, and the dish was still very tasty, so maybe the garlic is just supposed to be \"well done\"?  Anyway, thanks so much for a \"keeper\" recipe.",

What I sometimes do when I have that problem with other dishes is push some of the food towards the side, add a bit more olive oil and cook the garlic in that spot for a few seconds before stirring it through - just a minute or so before finishing the dish.",

      "content": "My son now makes this dish at a moment's notice, but (because he doesn't like raisins), we treat several of the ingredients as \"add-ons\", with a dish of plumped raisins, a dish of parsley, a dish of shaved parmesan, etc., all sitting on the table. The big win? Instead of just a dish of capers, he puts out a dish of shallow-fried capers (recipe: heat 1/8\" of oil in a pan. Fry capers until crisp; dry on a paper towel. Serve promptly, esp. in humid weather.) instead of just capers-from-the-jar. These add a wonderful crunch and an intensified flavor to the dish that just can't be beat. (And boy, does he outdo his college buddies, whose culinary skills range from hamburgers to pasta-with-red-sauce-from-a-jar and back!)",

      "content": "Thanks for your reply. This recipe was a big hit with our family - including my 7 year old son!  I love it when sophisticated flavor combinations are also kid-friendly.  I will definitely be making this again. Next time I would plan to either increase the amount of cauliflower/romanesco (I used a smallish head plus a quarter of another), or only make 12 oz of pasta instead of a full pound....although that would be a shame since the leftovers are also delicious. i'm also imagining a summer version where the cauliflower is replaced by eggplant - wouldn't that be delicious?",
