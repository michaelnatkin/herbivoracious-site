Carol Off's book Bitter Chocolate is a fantastic investigative and very readable book on this subject. I tweeted you the link. Thanks for bringing attention to this issue.",

It seems just about any huge, commercial, conventional product these days involves some form or another of enslavement.  It's so sad.

      "content": "i have known of tis dor years but do not have a blog platform to speak from , though our friends and family know where my husband and i stand.  years ago we started buying only fair trade coffee, chocolate, sugar and tea.  while the child slave labor is only as i know it in the chocolate, the other luxeries i named all come at a high price also, if you don't know your sources.  the paltry wages that men and women get for picking these luxuries that we can buy so cheaply is appalling.  my husband and i do not have a very large income.  in fact we are lower middle class.  so if we can't afford to buy fair trade coffee we don't have coffee in the morning.  i might add here we are both addicted to our morning cup of coffee.  yet how can i drink say folgers and know that somewhere someone is working a long day seven days a week and can't afford to feed his children, or get medical care, or send them to school.  so if we can't afford fair trade, we can't afford it.  they really are luxuries after all.",

      "content": "Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Chocolate sugar and coffee are luxuries and we can eat less of them and do what is right in this world. I often lie sleepless at night knowing how good I have it and that this is not true for many children (and adults) in this world. I have a special heart for children and I will indeed pay attention. We have some chocolate makers here in my town and I think I will just support them as much as I can.",

I think it's something that most people don't think about or know about. Usually we buy fair trade chocolate, but I often forget about it when I'm buying chocolate chips, for instance, for baking something. Thanks for the reminder!",

I think just allowing yourself to be open to the empathy towards other people even when it seems like the problems are too big to solve is such an important first step, and makes it seem like these relatively simple choices to pay attention to what we buy are the very least we can do!",

      "content": "Thanks for the interesting post. I agree that awareness of social justice in all things is important. One of the biggest problems I think regarding chocolate is that most often cocoa-producing countries such as the Ivory Coast only have a place in the global market with raw products. The premium charged for your finished, even fair trade, chocolate does not go back to the original producers but to Western chocolatiers. Even while there could be no chocolate without cocoa, the farmers who make it possible are not properly rewarded, neither directly nor indirectly through profits returned to their countries through manufacturing. There is a chocolate company called Omanhene chocolate (<a href=\"http://omanhene.com/)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://omanhene.com/)</a> that I think addresses this underlying social justice issue through their \"beyond fair trade\" policy. The chocolate is delicious to boot! I really recommend it! I think it's important to remember that many companies in countries where child labor is an issue also need the economic investment of consumers to whom they export goods in order to pull themselves out of the cycle of poverty and underdevelopment... and there are companies that deserve our support!",
