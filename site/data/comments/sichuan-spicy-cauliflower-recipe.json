I just went completely vegetarian a couple of weeks ago so am trying new recipes like crazy. You're definitely bookmarked :)",

      "content": "I liked this a lot, but I was using relatively new Sichuan peppercorns, and they had so much flavor that I found they overwhelmed the rest. (And I say that as someone who loves those peppercorns in lots of things). So I would recommend to others that they consider backing off those guys a little when they first make this recipe. I'll definitely make it again...but with about half the peppercorns.",
