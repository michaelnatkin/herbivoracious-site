      "content": "Hey Anne - your idea sounds delicious! One approach would be to puree and reverse-spherify the tomato, including a few drops of basil oil in the puree. Or if you want to keep the tomato whole, how about removing the skin and using a needle to inject a single drop of intensely flavored basil oil. That would be mysterious! Or, usually you would serve toast with a fried egg, so maybe some sort of a basil cracker / croquant / tuille.",

Ivy, if you have a link to that magazine piece you did, please mention it in the comments - I think people would appreciate your details on the best rice, vinegar and so forth.",
