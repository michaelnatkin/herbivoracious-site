I used about a half cup of \"thin\" coconut milk, and Japanese \"sushi rice\" (which I used without washing or anything). That worked out fine, although the coconut flavor was quite mild. I cooked the plaintains somewhat darker than yours (more of a dark brown than a pale yellow), and the slightly-caramelized flavor was a really nice addition. Also added some epazote to the black beans while I was cooking them, even though that's not traditionally carribean.",

Well he starts eating and says stop the chicken!  this is too good on its own!! I don't want the meat!  To say the least, it was a miracle.  I recommend this to everyone!",

Did anyone else experience this?  My husband and I decided that next time we'll gently cook the onions just a bit and make the mango sauce first, then let it sit for awhile to allow the flavors to blend.  I think we must be the only one to experience this- we were so eager to eat it that we ate through the onion tears, couldn't stop!  Thanks for the recipe!",

The only change I made was to leave out the jalapeno (I'm a weaksauce when it comes to heat) and to put some sriracha on my husbands rice and we both agreed it was one of the best things we've had. Thanks for a great recipe!!!",

Had to use sweet potatoes instead of plantains because my local market didn't have any.  Last thing was adding red and green bell pepper to the black beans.  I had brown basmati rice, which came out wonderfully with the coconut.  I could eat this weekly!!!",

We all felt this dish really doesn't need anything other than salt. It was perfect!",
