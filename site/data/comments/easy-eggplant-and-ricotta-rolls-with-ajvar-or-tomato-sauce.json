      "content": "Not only does this dish look easy and fun, but it is colorful and very appealing to look at.\n\nI really like that you suggested the used of tomato sauce, as I don't care for avjar.... but who doesn't love tomato sauce on just about anything! Plus, I am much more likely to have that on hand.\n\nI also really look that this looks classy and expensive, very good to impress people at dinner parties.\n\nWhat are some more ideas for classy looking foods that won't break the bank? But still taste yummy?",
