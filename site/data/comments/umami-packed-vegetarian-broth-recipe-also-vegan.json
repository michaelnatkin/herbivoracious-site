      "content": "Ok, so I knew some folks would have that concern so I should have addressed it in more detail. When that reaction between the anisole and anisidine in the star anise and the sulfur in the onions occurs, it totally changes the flavor of the star anise, to the point where there is barely a whisper of typical anise flavor in the resulting broth. I fed it to a confirmed anise/licorice hater and she was drinking the broth down as fast as I could pour! As far as I&#39;ve been able to determine, there isn&#39;t a substitute, and you can certainly omit it, but I think you should give it a shot, the transformation is pretty amazing.",

At the stage where you would bring it to high pressure, instead bring it to a covered simmer, and cook for about 45 minutes instead of 20. You won&#39;t get the same level of flavor extraction, and you&#39;ll lose some flavor to the air that would otherwise remain trapped in the pressure cooker, but it will still be damn good!",

A good tip is to freeze leftover stock in 1/2 cup increments.",

      "content": "Michael,\nThank you for this recipe. This is the best vegetarian broth recipe I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ve tried others as well as canned and powdered broths and they\u2019re usually too bland and/or loaded with salt and not much better than using plain water. I\u2019ve been looking for a vegetable broth that will contribute to the dish I\u2019m making but not overwhelm it. I think I\u2019ve found what I\u2019m looking for in your broth.\n\nJohn and Jill, the Veggie Queen, I\u2019m also not a fan of licorice-type flavors and I don\u2019t care for anise at all.  And like you Jill, I can take tarragon in small amounts. However I thought I\u2019d try the recipe once with the star anise. Next time I\u2019d probably use half of one star anise but would not cut it out totally. I think it contributes in a subtle way but does in no way scream \u201cthis broth tastes like star anise.\u201d I couldn\u2019t find marmite or vegemite locally and didn\u2019t want to bother ordering it online. The Veggie Queen suggested I substitute miso, which I did.\n\nA friend I shared the recipe with thought it would likely be too flavorful for most of what she\u2019d use a vegetarian broth for.  Of course I don\u2019t know her tastes and everything she\u2019d add vegetarian broth to, but I think as long as the broth is diluted when used as an ingredient, it will work perfectly. It makes a nice broth for eating right from the pot, but because it\u2019s nice and rich (a good thing!), it can be diluted.\n\nThanks again for the recipe, Michael.",

I usually pressure-cook stocks, but in MC and MC at Home they recommended sous-vide 3 hours at 85\u00baC plus 12 hours cold infusion for vegetable stocks in order to obtain a more subtle and aromatic flavour. I recently did a side-to-side test with exactly the same ingredients (shown here, in Spanish I'm afraid: http://dorarnosella.com/2012/10/28/fondo-de-verduras-comparacion-entre-sous-vide-y-olla-rapida/ ). The SV stock was certainly more aromatic and delicate, whereas the pressure-cooked was stronger, more intense. I would rather have the SV version for a consomm\u00e9, and the pressure-cooked version for sauces, rice bases, etc. Also the pressure-cooked is much faster and easier to prepare.",

The difference between making this broth on regular stove top and PC is surprising.  Who knew that so much deliciousness was escaping?  It's still a great broth if you don't make with PC, but start saving for your own PC.  Only exclusion on my part is the marmite--I really don't like the taste of it, and if it makes the broth \"meatier\" tasting, it's not for me.",

Watered it down a little bit, strained it, picked some really soft shitakes from the mix and threw in some fresh sliced button mushroom. Added in some rice noodles, some baby swiss chard leaves.

It is that good.\n\nSo, thank you for your inspirational recipe, and I look forward to perusing your site.  I recognized from the ingredients that it would be very good, and had everything on hand but the marmite, and miso filled in quite nicely.  But, what sold me was your rap on Marcella's minnestrone.

      "content": "I am in love with this broth. Holy crap.  I'm on a liquid diet for an illness called gastroparesis, and I've done bone broths and veggie broths and bullion for years, but i've gotten so tired of them, and felt like I'd exhausted my options for switching up the flavors.  I found this, though, and it's so, so delicious!  Instead of marmite, I used a salt-free yeast extract (basically marmite without the sodium - too much salt bothers me) that I'm obsessed with, cut out the salt, and instead added the juice from a can of black olives for a little sodium and even more flavor.  Black olive juice sounds weird, but don't knock it 'til you try it!  I'm almost out of my current batch, and am going out for ingredients tomorrow.  Obviously this wouldn't work for vegetarians/vegans, but do you think bonito flakes would be good in this, too?  Thanks so muh for this recipe - I'm so happy to have found a totally new and delicious broth option.  :)",

I made it pretty much as you indicated, including star anise ;)\nI have a question though, when shopping for kombu, the closest thing I found was \"konbu\" - Laminaria angustata - do you know if that's the same seaweed or not?",

      "content": "Broths like this one can be made elegant by clarifying. You link to Dave Arnold's agar method but it isn't as easy as it's described and it really doesn't produce crystal clear results. Almost nothing does. But I have found that using PTFE or polypropylene filters will give results similar to agar if done right. The filters are used for industrial purposes and come right down to 1 micron in filtering diameter. I just heat up..only to warm..what I want clarify and pour it through a stack of a strainer or chinois  with a layer of 1 micron filter below it. The results are a very clear broth and fast. The filters come as \"socks\" or tubes about 10 inches in diameter and 24 to 36 inches long.  I cut them into manageable squares or rounds and 1 sock will yield a lifetimes filters. They can be hand washed or put in the dishwasher. Cheap too.",
