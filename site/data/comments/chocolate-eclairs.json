      "content": "Eclairs are something I learned to make a couple of years ago.  They're popular with my family and my peeps and they use up buckets of eggs (My best friend has fifty chickens.  Using up eggs is a constant challenge.).\n\nI use the (New) Joy of Cooking choux paste recipe, which works for me.  I fill them with the vanilla pastry cream recipe (also in Joy) and top the eclairs with the bittersweet chocolate ganache-like thing (Joy, again) which is made of chocolate chips (I use ghirardelli), butter, and water.\n\nYou can take these places, like to an event or party distant from your home, by glazing the hollow eclairs but not filling them.  Schlep along the filling in a ziplock nestled in an ice-filled cooler.  Upon arrival at destination, fill eclairs immediately before serving them.  This prevents the sog problem and simplifies the food-safety issues in transit.",

      "content": "I'm a beginner and I tried to make the \u00e9clairs. It all went wrong, HAHAHAhahahaa\nI didn't have unsalted butter, so I used the salted one anyway... The pastry didn't have the consistency to pipe, I don't know why. I didn't have the corn syrup, so I didn't put it on the glaze (the only thing that tasted good). I put the boiling milk too fast on the pastry cream and it turned into chocolate scrambled eggs (thing I had the misfortune to find out with my tongue) that mixed with the salty of the pastry (salted butter...), covered with the chocolate glaze. You can imagine my reaction after tasting that (automatically spitted all out). But the idea of the eclair is still in my head, so I'll try again 'till it's good. Your eclair looks beautiful, by the way! :)",
