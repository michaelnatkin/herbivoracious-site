      "content": "Hello Michael,\n1. I just found your blog and I have to tell your it's amazing! I love it! \n2. Congratulations on a book, I've pre-ordered it through Amazon already. \n3. Recipes are great. This one is something I would make for dinner if I were in Seattle and Uwajimaya was just around the corner. I am going to look for yuba here. Who knows! \nAnyway, I am glad I found your blog for recipes, for inspiration, and for ... piece of Seattle, that I really miss... \nThanks!",
