A rosemary-white bean spread is almost always on the menu, along with some kind of cheese, some kind of tomatoes, and usually a crunchy veggie like fennel to dip. Yum.\n\nMichael, I forget - have you ever posted about the book _Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day_? I'm floored by how easy they make breadmaking, and I'd love to hear your take on it sometime.",
