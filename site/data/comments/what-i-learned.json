      "content": "Thanks for this great review. I've always wondered how it is to work in a small restaurant and I have this, probably very romantic, vision about how it could be. Do you think you'd go back to cooking again or will you end up continuing with engineering? I'm an engineer myself (civil) and have been on a hiatus for almost 5 years now. However, I'm beginning to miss the challenges and security engineering offered.\n\nGood luck to you, though.",

But now I am thinking about arranging my own short-term internship, probably solely on salads...to specialize. I am thinking the Ebbit Room, in  Cape May, NJ... I love that you interned. This would be a nice way for me to explore only the high-end gourmet contributions to salads. Thanks for that",
