It's from Taiwan...I always prefer to buy Taiwanese over mainland products when possible.\n\nAnd I generally add an equivalent amount of chili garlic (or plain chili) paste, as I like my spice level at 11 (on a scale of 1-10!).",

      "content": "The paste I buy doesn't seem to have an English name, but there's a little red camel on the label. When I buy boxed century eggs, I check the label for the source. It's usually easy to tell, as the ones from mainland China are cheaper.\n\nHere in Seattle, I sometimes buy these (relatively) non-perishables at Viet Wah. If the owner's around, he can be quite helpful. HT Oaktree Plaza is also good, and then there's Uwajimaya. Further out, Central Market, H Mart, and Ranch 99 are also options.",

I cooked mine with Cabbage, Bean sprouts, Spring Onion and Prawns.\n\nI also tried making a similar sauce using basic components:\n1 tbsp each of Fu Chi Chili Bean Sauce, Sambal Olek, light soy sauce, sesame oil and a clove of minced garlic. It wasn't quite the same - being a mish-mash of different Asian countries - but was still pretty tasty.",

      "content": "I live in the Guilin area and suggest you try this with Fuzhou (doufu bamboo) rather than soft Doufu. Stir fried Fuzhu is a common dish in these parts and has a lot more texture. If you cannot find it freeze your regular Doufu for a week in the freezer, defrost and drain by squeezing it like a sponge using your hands or a spatula. This will give the Doufu a lot more texture.",
