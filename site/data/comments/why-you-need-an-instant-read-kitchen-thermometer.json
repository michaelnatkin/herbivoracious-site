I've never been sure whether the temp that appears at first is correct, or should I continue to watch as it keeps going higher (which is usually way higher than I actually intended!).  I've never seen anything about waiting to stabilize.  (My gadget is from Polar and 10 years old.)  Thanks.",

Also, if you've had it for ten years and never recalibrated it, you are way overdue - check the manual (which you can probably find online) for the proper steps.",

But, as you mentioned, I only use it to take surface temperatures of pans (and pressure cookers) -not particularly good with reflective materials like stainless steel.But they are handy for taking temperature of something in the oven or refrigerator.\n\nThey infrared are tons of fun when you first get them - especially for zapping you kid's foreheads floor, door, animals running across the yard....  \n\nYou get the idea.  More a toy than a tool ; )\n\nCiao,\n\nL",

I've been wondering if it would be worth the price. \n\nI started using a thermometer for bread baking and it makes a big difference because it takes the guesswork out of knowing when bread is done. Even that tapping on the bottom trick is pretty ambiguous, not to mention that it requires turning a hot and squishy loaf of bread upside down!",

      "content": "Good move, Jesse. You\u2019re going to love the Thermapen, Michael.  I recently purchased a Thermapen and am loving it. Over the years I\u2019ve purchased various thermometers that just didn\u2019t work very well. They were slow, difficult to use and often not very accurate.  I wish I'd have just spent the money for a Thermapen and have been done with it. I've easily spent what the Thermapen costs and gotten inferior products. Thermapens are not inexpensive, but in my opinion they\u2019re worth every penny.\n\nThermapen\u2019s instructions are excellent and explain why Georgia, that the temperature reading doesn\u2019t really stabilize or to use Thermapen\u2019s terminology, \u201cit doesn\u2019t lock in on a reading.\u201d Initially when you penetrate the meat on a grill, for example, the display changes rapidly at it moves from ambient temperature to the temperature of the meat. Within 3 seconds the rate of change slows dramatically giving you an accurate reading, but it will not stop changing completely. Why? Because the meat on the grill continues to cook and the Thermapen continues to detect variations in the temperature of the meat. I recognize that you\u2019re using a different brand \u2013 I think you meant Polder rather than Polar \u2013 but I suspect it functions similarly. To answer your question, the temperature you see first is probably not accurate as it takes any thermometer some period of time (3 seconds with a Thermapen, longer for other brands) to register the actual temperature of the food being measured.  Initially the reading changes rapidly and then slows down though technically it won\u2019t \u201cstabilize\u201d though it should change slowly at that point. Jesse Black, feel free to jump in if I\u2019ve said anything that is not accurate.\n\nThe Thermapen user guide also provides clear instructions for checking the accuracy of any thermometer. These same instructions appear online here: http://www.thermoworks.com/learning/thermapen101_creating_an_icebath.html",

      "content": "Another vote for using infrared thermometers on pans. Especially something like a cast-iron skillet where it takes some time to warm up, you can be sure the pan is hot enough before adding your ingredients. Especially when I just moved to an apartment with an electric range, I found myself using it constantly before I had an intuition for how quickly it heated things up.",
