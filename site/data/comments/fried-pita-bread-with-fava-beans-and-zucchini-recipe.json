In truth, I'd be overjoyed to eat this anytime, breakfast included! Amazing combination of flavors - just gorgeous! Lucky me - I have some stale pita bread and a zucchini in my fridge at this very moment!",

I used chickpeas, and instead of plain water, I used about half a cup of tomato water that I had on hand from draining some chopped, roasted fresh tomatoes. The extra tomato flavor married everything together. What a great quick dinner!",
