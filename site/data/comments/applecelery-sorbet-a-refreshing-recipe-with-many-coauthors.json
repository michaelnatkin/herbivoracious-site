If you stumble across Chef Wilson again, please find out how he made the bacon creme fraiche that was on his tasting menu back in August when I visited from the East Coast.\n\nThat was a little bit of heaven on earth on top of some panna cotta and under steelhead roe. Salivating now thinking of it.",

      "content": "I think if you make them with pulp and not just juice, you might end up with an unpleasant texture (and indeed that sounds like what happens in that link). You certainly could add additional flavors in there, though I think the real beauty in this kind of sorbet is the very bright, clear taste of the main ingredients. Sometimes less is more. Instead of directly adding more flavors, another thought would be to use this sorbet as part of a plated dessert with other compatible components. You could do something humorous and good by including some textural plays on peanut butter and raisins to evoke the idea of childhood after-school snacks.",
