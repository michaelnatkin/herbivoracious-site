I just did a quick search to refresh my memory and sure enough there is a \"Hawaii Popcorn Company\" that sells packets of microwave popcorn with toppings that include mochi crunch (rice crackers), nori and butter flavoring.",

This stuff is ground so fine it doesn&#39;t take much fat at all. But if you are an air-popper than yeah, you will need to add something to create a little stickiness.",
