I&#39;m sure it would be good though, if you have access to them!\n\n\n\n\nMichael Natkin\n\n\nFind me:\n\nThe latest from my blog, Herbivoracious:  Was Your Chocolate Made with Child Slave\u00a0Labor?",

      "content": "Well... It has been a while since you posted this recipe, I suppose. But since I only discovered your marvellous website a week ago, could I please be excused? :)\n\nRegarding this recipe: MY. Herbivoracious, indeed... I was anxious how the sauce would turn out, since I couldn't get hold of Thai basil. And as always in times of stress and ignorance, I turned to the internet. And lo and behold, it told me that Thai basil tastes a bit like anise, also quite a bit sharp and hotter than Italian basil. So I got out my self made five-spice powder, containing star anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper and ground fennel seeds. And what should I say - maybe it's not a hundred per cent your sauce, but it still tastes awesome!\n\nNow I'm SO looking forward to my bento tomorrow... :)\n\nSo, in conclusion: Thanks A LOT for this recipe! It will be treasured, enjoyed and cooked many times in the future.\n\nLove,\nNaurael",
