I'm not a kimchi connoisseur, but I've found it super-easy and quick to make (if you don't count letting it sit for a few days).",

      "content": "Hey Michael! \nWhat a great recipe! I think the addition of radish sprouts and asparagus makes this dish a beautiful kiss of sophistication. :-)\nSo I just read up on what the difference is between Jollmyun and Nangmyun. Jollmyun was made actually by a mistake at a Nangmyun factory in Incheon back in the 70s. A factory worker set the noodle press wrong by mistake and the noodle that came out of it was much thicker than how Nangmyun is supposed to be. The factory couldn't sell it so they gave the noodle away for free to a snack bar nearby and the owner mixed it with the gochujang sauce like you have, with cucumber and whatnot. This dish became really popular since then, and it's a staple dish at every corner snack bar in Korea. \nJollmyun is very chewy, from a word \"Jollgit\". The dough is mixed with 130-150celsius heat from the beginning, and also with a lot of pressure, and this apparently gives the dough the chewiness. It's basically made with a similar process as making Ddokbokki Ddok.\nSo. I'm glad I found this out too. I never knew why the Jollmyun is so chewy. \nI think everybody who grew up in Korea has a great memory eating Jollmyun, most probably from eating after school at a snack bar. Yum! \nI\nSee ya!",
