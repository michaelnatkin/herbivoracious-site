      "content": "I love using curry leaves in Indian recipes!! You are right that they are incredibly aromatic - I especially like them in lentil stews or \"dal\" - they add a wonderful depth of flavor to the dish. I love the simplicity of this recipe - will definitely be trying it soon!",

      "content": "In Seattle, I see them at Asian and Indian groceries, like Uwajimaya, HT at Oaktree Plaza, or Apna Bazaar in Bellevue. I assume the same would be true in other cities. It may be worth calling around first, as it could be hit and miss - ask if they have *fresh* curry leaves. And don't forget you can freeze them, so once you find a pack they can last awhile.",

      "content": "I can't wait to try this.  Also inspires me to try to locate a curry plant.  I used to ride the bus to work and the bus driver who was an Indian from Singapore taught me about curry leaves.  He told me about a plant that was growing wild in a vacant lot...no idea how it got there.  Now torn down so I am on the hunt to buy my own.  Kudos  to the lady moving and taking here Kaffir lime tree with her.  Mine sits on my front porch where it is protected from strong winds and the gardener and mail man who seemed to have a go-round with it last year.  This year I have fruit too!",

Sounds interesting, but very different. The curry leaf we are looking for looks like this: http://ninecooks.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451fa5069e20167613e9dfc970b-800wi",

      "content": "Hi, \nA less confusing way to spell the name of these leaves would be : kadhi leaves. \nCurry in India more or less just means \"sauce\" and it has nothing to do with the word \"kadhi\" (no r, but a deep d). Kadhi leaves are ubiquitous in the cuisine of the state of Maharashtra and in southern India. \nThey are two completely different words- hence, no confusion!!\nBtw, I just discovered your site and am loving it. Thanks for the great vegetarian recipes from around the world.",
