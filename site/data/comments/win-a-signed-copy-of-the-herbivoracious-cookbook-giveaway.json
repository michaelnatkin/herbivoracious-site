They were amazed at how good they were. Since then, I've been working my way through the blog, recipe by recipe. I've turned a ton of my friends onto Herbivoracious (vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike,) and used your orecchiette recipe for my pre-half-marathon pasta dinner. Herbivoracious has never let me down (except the one time I used bad ricotta to make the spinach lasagna.)\n\nThanks for the beautiful food photos, the tips about cast iron, tofu and for being my go-to food blog!",

The 3 recipes that you sent with the confirmation looks so tempting as do the ones that i have already looked at  on the site.  I would love to win the recipe book, but would receive great pleasure in gifting it to my son and daughter in law.  They entertain every Friday night for dinner and usually each Saturday afternoon as well as many Sundays.   They enjoy vegetarian dishes and some of their guests dont eat meat at all.  Winning would give me the thrill of the win, pleasure in gifting it to them and knowing they have a compilation of wonderful foods to enjoy and entertain with.  Thank you for  your consideration.",
