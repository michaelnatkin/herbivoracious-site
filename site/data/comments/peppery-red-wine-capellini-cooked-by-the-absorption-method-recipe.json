Snapping long pasta is practically against the law in Italy - there is probably an authority to check for that too.\n\nDoes the red wine evaporate some or does it still taste a bit like it would in a glass?\n\nFascinating!!!\n\nL",

      "content": "Since this one is fideos-style, snapping the noodles is appropriate, but if you were doing it for an Italian dish I don't see why it wouldn't work without breaking them, you just would need to use a large enough pot. The same approach works with shaped instead of long pasta, too. The harsh alcohol bite tends to evaporate leaving more of the fruit/acid/tannin of the wine, which is delicious.",

      "content": "Michael, I tried substituting a gluten free spaghetti (I selected for the thinnest I could find in the hope it would be 'like' angel hair (my chosen pasta was by Bionature and was an organic rice, soy and potato combination). Unfortunately what we wound up with was very gummy. I wonder if the GF pasta is not well suited to this technique, if I didn't execute properly somehow (it reminded me of boiling pasta in too little water and the starchy outcome that can result), or if anyone has experience with a different GF pasta and better results in absorption cooking? My wife suggested we try the dangmyeon sweet potato noodles used for Jap Chae. \n\nSo many of your recipes are already gluten free or easily modified to be gluten free, which we very much appreciate, we thought we could just make an easy substitution. Alas, not on try one.\n\nOn the other hand we have had great success over the past few weeks with your Tteokbokki, Chickpea and Saffron Pilaf, and Brussels Sprouts and Apple Hash. All will make regular appearances on our table going forward.",

I will definetly try :) And, yes, cooking spaghetti takes just too much time - absorption is better ;)",
