      "content": "Hey Terri Sue -\u00a0\n\n\nWell, fennel pollen isn&#39;t as expensive by weight as saffron, but it is expensive.. a small jar will set you back a bit over $20, but you don&#39;t need much per serving so it isn&#39;t thaaaat bad. But you can absolutely leave it off of this dish and it will still be delish.\n\n\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

Realistically, you're probably gonna get 1t. That's just not a whole lot, esp. if the rest of your meal isn't too fatty either. Skip the cannoli for dessert, and you can eat all four helpings and still come out ahead!",
