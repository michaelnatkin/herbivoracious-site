And making mango hedgehogs was really fun. This is one of those rare dishes where it looks as good when *I* make it as when the Michael does. :)\n\nOne small quibble: I found the English cuke surprisingly flavorless (maybe it's just the season...dunno). I think I'd prefer an american cuke's flavor here.",
