It is, however, missing 2 touches that will make it even better!  This is popular for Shabbat (Sabbath) lunch. Since traditionally one does not cook on Shabbat, the ingredients are prepared ahead of time. This results in an eggplant marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, garlic and cialntro that is simply divine in itself.\n\nAlso, for the same reason,  eggs are typically slow-boiled with onion skins and sometimes  ground coffee, createing a yummy, almost carmel-like result. Even if you do a quick-boiled version, without  \"brown eggs\" (also known as huevos huminados) it is simply not the same -- please do try it!",

The only downside is peeling the eggplant skin post grilling. Also, I used a cilantro/jalapeno hummus. It was delicious. Thank you.\n\nFranco",

Halfway through cooking the eggs you can crack the shells a little and the egg whites will develop some color. Sort of like tie dying.
