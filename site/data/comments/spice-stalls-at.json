      "content": "You can order dry harissa from Victorian Epicure (<a href=\"http://www.epicureselections.com)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.epicureselections.com)</a> or make your own. This recipe is one I googled (it is originally from Art  Culinare, September 22, 2008 though I got it off Access my Library)and lists only the ingredients. Presumably you roast the spices individually just till they release their fragrance, then set aside and grind them in a mortar and pestle or spice-only coffee grinder.\nThe harissa mix:\n4 dried ancho chilis, toasted and ground\n1 dried New Nexican chile, toasted and ground 2 tablespoons coriander seeds, toasted and ground 2 tablespoons caraway seeds, toasted and ground\n1 tablespoon cumin seeds, toasted and ground\n2 tablespoons dry mint 2 tablespoons paprika\n\nI like this spice blend with fish, chicken and any kind of lentils or beans.",
