I've written about it on several occasions, especially when it comes to desserts.  Even if people get over the hurdle of putting enough salt in their savory foods, they rarely use enough--if any--salt in their desserts.\n\nSo great to see someone else extolling the virtues of salt! :)",

      "content": "Jenni - you are so right about salt in dessert. Almost all desserts benefit from at least a subtle pinch or two to bring out the flavors. And many desserts, especially if they include chocolate or caramel, are amazing with a fairly sizeable amount of salt. My standard move when following someone else&#39;s recipe for, say, brownies or chocolate chip cookies is to double the salt. (But don&#39;t do that with any recipes you find on my site, or they really will be too salty!)",

      "content": "That's my rule as well.  Double the salt.  I generally figure 1/4 teaspoon (give or take) per 1 cup of flour in baked goods.  In custards, it makes all the difference in the world.  I bet that most people who say they hate creme brule haven't had a well-seasoned creme brule. :)",

      "content": "I couldn't agree more with these points. I have seen so many home cooks as well as some professionals struggle with this. I know many have said it before but there really is no better way to season then to taste as you go. Without a little taste here and there how do you know where your dish stands? As for knife skills learn the basics and the rest will follow. Master how to slice or dice and onion and you have tackled one of the most common obstacles. These truly are the perfect start to better food from your kitchen at home.",

Off to find a class near me now!\n\nAlso, while this is really basic, having one's ingredients in place and ready to go BEFORE cooking is a huge confidence booster in the kitchen--that way you're not scrambling at the last minute for the goshdarned garlic while everything else is sizzling away in the skillet. (Not that that's happened to me, or anything...)",

My stepsister refuses to put salt in her food and of course, almost everything is bland. There's got to be a happy medium.\n\nPersonally, I think if you cook from scratch at home, the whole sodium issue isn't as crazy its made out to be (unless you have health problems, of course). It's the junk and fake food that we should worry about. If you put a teaspoon of salt on one serving of home-made food, it would be inedible. But that's how much is lurking in a fast food meal.",

      "content": "I find almost all restaurants oversalt their food, there are a lot of flavours in food that get drowned out by salt and so many other ingedients I use e.g. tamari, miso, many cheeses already contain enough salt. As for knife grips, if your blade is properly sharpened and the spine of your knife has been properly fettled there is no problem with guiding the blade with your index finger on the spine.  I used a standard pinch grip for years until it became too painful, from a series of injuries unrelated to cooking, and have migrated to a grip with my index finger along the spine. My wrist couldn't be happier. But, do not use the index finger to force your blade, sharp is essential, and keep the grip relaxed and you'll be OK with your finger on the spine.",

However, a lot of times I am in too much of a hurry to do the taste and salt test. Using the .5% of total weight is a <b>great</b> idea. Thanks for saving my quick meal's taste!",
