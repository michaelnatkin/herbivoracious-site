All in the metaphysics of food.\n\nI've been shredding carrots with other veggies in an herbed water-lemon infusion for quick wrap sandwiches for decades.  The carrots are so pretty, my kids never stopped once to think \"Mom's trying to feed us vegetables\".\n\n:-)",

      "content": "Nice! We really liked this, but even with one lemon it was a bit more sour than I'd like. I might increase the cumin to 1.5t, and use less honey and lemon.  One other thing: when I poured the oil over the carrots, some remained behind. So I grabbed some carrots and stirred them around in the oily pan to get the last of it. I used the aleppo pepper -- perhaps 1/2t -- and it was great.",

I got excited and didn't read through the instructions so I just added the spices and oil without simmering first but it still tastes wonderful and refreshing. I also added fresh parsley from my garden so I was excited about that. This would also be good as an addition to spinach or romaine salad.",

I'd love to try this salad with the fried cumin, paprika, and cayenne. I make an Indian-style carrot salad that's kind of a simple cousin of this one. You fry black mustard seeds in vegetable oil for a few seconds and then pour it over the carrots.",

Most of my recipes fall into the category of super-quick yet flavorful, healthy and family-friendly. This recipe is a winner on all fronts - can't wait to try it!",
