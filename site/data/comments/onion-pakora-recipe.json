      "content": "Hey Martin - yeah, that can be an issue for me as well. You can put it through a coffee filter and then store it in the refrigerator, but I agree, a month can be a long time to store it. Another option, since you've probably only fried a little bit in it, is just to use it up over the next few weeks as your regular oil that you are going to saute in, grease pans, etc. Just taste it first to make sure it didn't acquire too strong a flavor.",

How is that possible?) so I subbed coriander. Which seemed like it worked very well. These were delicious. Completely!",

      "content": "Actually, I hadn't read the recipe but I'm curious about your use of water. Most pakora recipes begin by mixing the sliced onions with a generous amount of salt which, after about 15 mins, draws out the water from the onion, then flour is mixed in to obtain the correct consistency, but no other liquid be that either water or oil, is added. \n\nDoes your method have any advantage(s) over the more traditional one?",
