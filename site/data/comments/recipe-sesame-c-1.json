One question/problem though - the muffins stuck to the paper quite a bit. This has happened with other recipes and I don't know how to prevent it. They were still pretty hot at the time we dug in. They didn't seem overcooked. Thoughts?",

I guess if you know you are going\nto do that you could supplement the parchment paper cups with a spray of oil\n(Westbrae or Spectrum makes a natural one, or you can use a pump).",
