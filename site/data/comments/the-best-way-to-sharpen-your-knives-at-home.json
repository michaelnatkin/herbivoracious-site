      "content": "I also find that this $9 sharpener works really damn good. It won't really repair long-neglected knives, but it's great for putting on an edge every time I take my knife out. It looks like crap, but it puts a razor edge on my Dexter in less than 5 seconds.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/AccuSharp-1-001-Knife-Sharpener/dp/B00004VWKQ/&tag=herbivoracious-shop-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">AccuSharp</a>",

      "content": "I considered spending that much but ended up with an under $10 sharpener called AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener. It actually shaves off minute slivers of steel and would be the wrong choice for expensive Japanese blades (which have a different blade angle anyway).\nBut with a few light strokes any knife becomes razor sharp.\nOne deciding factor for me was: it takes up no space at all in my knife drawer, requires no power, or counter space, and I can simply take it along when I cook at a shelter.\nI also bought their garden tools variety.",

      "content": "The problem with machines is they take off too much of the edge, plus if the knife has a thick heel, like the one in the photo, it will not pass through the grinder and you'll end up with a concave profile on your blade. You're better off buying a decent sharpening stone and learning how it use it, or taking it to a professional.",

      "content": "Not all machines are the same. The fine wheel on the Chefs Choice is akin to a strop; it definitely doesn't take off too much of your metal. I've used it on my knives hundreds of times with no ill effect, and it gives me a very nice edge. Not quite the absolute razor edge I can get with practiced use of the finest stone, but very respectable.",
