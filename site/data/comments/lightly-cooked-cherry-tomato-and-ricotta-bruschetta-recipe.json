      "content": "Made this last night with Sun Gold yellow cherry tomatoes, a seed-crusted baguette, and mozzarella (because it's what we had on hand). Everyone loved it, but if I did it again, I'd halve the salt. I also would cook the tomatoes a little less. I tried 2 min with half my tomatoes, found them a bit TOO soft, and did about 1 min with the other half, and then combined them. My tomatoes had to sit a few minutes because of other things I was doing, and they left behind some juice, which I drizzled over about half the bruschetta with good results. Hint for the mozzarella: if you want really thin slices (you do!), really easily, you can use one of those hard-boiled-egg slicers that cut with thin wires.\n\nBTW, we served this with steamed artichokes & a sauce of cumin-balsamic vinegar-mayonnaise, and courgettes aux citron, and it made a just-about-perfect late-summer meal.",
