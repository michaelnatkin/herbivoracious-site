      "content": "It would be nice if future themes reflect awareness of the fact that we eat in the context of 854 million people in the world who are currently experiencing hunger and that hunger persists even in the United States (34 million people are hungry including 16.9 percent of all children in the U.S.).  Too many food blogs exude over-abundance, over-consumption and self-indulgence.  I will continue to read your blog because I am interested in vegetarian food, the history and culture of food, can always use your insightful tips on preparation, and enjoy your writing style.  How about 'Vegetarian Envy' for a name?",

      "content": "Amazing who and what you'll discover wandering aimlessly around the food related blogosphere. Look forward to following your cooking adventures. I can relate to the turn-off aspect of the term \"foodie\". I also find \"vegetarian\" an ambigous term. Never can be sure if that mean dairy and eggs are are in or out. The first name that came to mind when I read your \"mission statement\" was: Meatless TLC. But I think the other suggestions are better and I just realized that \"meatless\" presumes one considers fish a meat.\n\nWhat about \"Vegicurious\" (a twist on epicurious) or \"Vegimand\"?  Vegetarian Virtue (could do interesting things with a VV logo). OK I can tell my creative zeitgeist is waning... Hey there you go, Veggie Zeitgeist...\n\nCheers",

My brother recently suggested \"The Vegetarian Blowtorch\"! That might be it.",
