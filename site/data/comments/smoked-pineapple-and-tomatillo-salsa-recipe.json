      "content": "Hey Condimentary - yes, chipotle in adobo is a good option for smokiness if you don&#39;t want to do it yourself. There are some tradeoffs of course - it adds heat and tomato etc that you might not want, and it also lacks some of the notes that freshly made smoke produces. You can also sometimes find morita chiles, which are the dried smoked jalapenos without any sauce.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Natkin\n\n\nFind me:\n\nThe latest from my blog, Herbivoracious:  Smoked Pineapple and Tomatillo Salsa - Recipe",

I discovered your site while google searching a new recipe I was about to post to make sure I was original- apparently my stuffed tortillas were very much like your Pupusas de Queso. I still posted my recipe, but I made sure to mention that they were like a traditional Salvadoran treat and linked to your website.\nI'm glad I found you here though, and will be coming back to read more!",

Not vegetarian here ... so in addition to serving with chips .... put on wild sockeye salmon that i had grilled .... delish!\n\nalso made the cowboy beans .... yum! everyone loved them and amazingly enough there were some left over the next day ... even better!\n\nI did the smoking in the pan with steamer basket but out on the gas grill. seemed to work. both recipes seemed easy to make and tasted amazing.\n\nI always give credit where credit is due .... you do make me look good though and add so much enjoyment to our meals.\n\nThanks!",
