      "content": "Excellent post on crisp-frying up tofu.  One additional tip:  in order to make the tofu even more moisture-free, zap it in the microwave for a minute or two and pat dry with towels each time.  Microwaving will \"cook\" it a bit, bringing to the fore more moisture which is what you wish to remove before you put it into your skillet to brown.\n\nI trust this is helpful!",

I blush at your saying that \"Asian Tofu\" is the *new definitive\" work on the lil' bean curd. \n\nLove that you point out the wealth of artisan tofu shops in Asian communities all over the US. You just have to look for these mom-and-pop places. Asian markets often stock local tofu because freshness is key to tofu lovers. \n\nWhen I interviewed tofu makers in Japan, Taiwan and China, they often said that their tofu shops are the equivalent of our local bakeries. People go daily for some tofu, take it home and cook it. It's an everyday food. Only in supermarkets did I see tofu in tubs. It's typically put into plastic bags and carried off.\n\nWith regard to frying tofu, if you soak it in salted hot water for about 15 minutes, drain, then shallow-fry or deep-fry, it gets a gorgeous crust and is lightly seasoned. And, you can keep tofu that you've fried around for days! I often call for that in Asian Tofu as it makes a really nice fried tofu.",

I'll do a side-by-side comparison, should be a cool learning experience.",

Then when the initial tofu goes in, I don't touch it at all. Even when I'm tempted to move it around. I leave it for a few minutes until a small shake to the pan moves the tofu. This has prevented many \"tofu sticks\" to the bottom of the pan which can happen if it's too watery (imo).  I would echo the high quality extra-firm Asian tofus (and wow what awesome reader recs for where to buy). Abroad, I found the best tofu at, no surprise, Thai and Korean shops. \nMmm I love tofu.",

I don't know any tofu-makers in Utah, but I can recommend a couple books for you that I think are especially good for new veggies: Madhur Jaffrey's excellent \"World Vegetarian\" is great if, like me, you like diverse eats.  Mark Bittman's \"Food Matters Cookbook\" is good for people transitioning to vegetarianism, and lots of the recipes are very easy to make.  And the excellent folks at Post-Punk Kitchen (http://www.theppk.com/) have a great selection of cookbooks, my favorite of which is \"Veganomicon.\"  I don't have Michael's book yet, but I've tried several of the recipes on this site, and they're excellent, so check those out as well!  Many vegetarian recipes are completely tofu-free.",

Soaked one in salted water that I brought to a boil and poured over the tofu, left the other as is. Patted them both dry and pan-fried as described. Indeed! The soaked one got a significantly crisper, thicker crust that I really liked. I couldn't noticeably taste the seasoning, but the the crust was a big improvement. Considering how easy this is to do, I'm going to add it as an optional step in the article. Thanks for suggesting it! I'm curious what is happening scientifically that creates the difference in crust.",

      "content": "If there's not a tofu shop near you, which is my situation, it's relatively easy to make your own tofu from store-bought soy milk. \n\n500ml soy milk\n1tsp nigari OR 2tsp calcium sulfate dissolved in 8oz hot water\n\nBring the soy milk to near scalding. Make the solution from nigari (or calcium sulfate) in 8oz water while the soy milk heats up. Once it's hot, pour 3/4 of the coagulant solution into the pot, stirring gently. Allow to rest for two minutes. After resting, stir very gently, checking for any liquid, milky areas. If there are some, use the other 1/4 of the solution. If not, and if the soy milk has separated into small, white curds of tofu and an amber liquid (whey), you're ready to put the curds into your tofu mold. Line the mold with cheesecloth, then pour the curd in. Place a weight on top (I use right around 5lbs.) and allow to sit for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, empty the resulting block into a tub of cold water, and allow to rest for one hour before storing in the fridge. Change the soaking water daily. \n\nNigari is nearly impossible to find locally in the US, but it's easily available on the internet. Best tofu ever.",

Frozen uncooked tofu has a changed texture, but after too much time in the freezer it gets dry and spongy. I'm thinking the absorbed oil might help that.\n\n2.

One thing you could do is to use an online calculator like this one: http://recipes.sparkpeople.com/recipe-calculator.asp - depending on which nutrients you are concerned about, you probably don't need to enter every minor ingredient, just the main carb and fat ones. I was surprised at how comprehensive these tools can be though. As a test, I put in \"kochujang\", which is a Korean chili paste, and the info came right up.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

I also find that when frying, fry for considerably longer than you would think was necessary, then just when the tofu is crisp and browning nicely, add a little honey and soy sauce. The honey caramelises adding a little flavour but a lot of colour.",

I feel like I'm learning to cook all over again.\n\nIn the Dallas, Texas area, the best tasting tofu I can get my hands on is Wildwood Sproutofu.  I  actually live in deep East Texas (cattle &amp; poultry country).  Finding good tofu is IMPOSSIBLE.  Just the other day, I drove 160 miles roundtrip for tofu &amp; organic produce.  It's crazy, but completely worth it.  Anyhoo.\n\nThanks again!",

I see them change their minds when they are overweight or obese and face serious health issues. It makes me a bit crazy that they wait that long.\n\nIf you continue to consume a meat-based diet and lead a sedentary lifestyle, chances are the you will encounter some chronic (but preventable) illness, whether it be heart disease (the leading killer in the U.S.), cancer, stroke, diabetes and more. Or a number of them at once. That's the bummer.\n\nWe all have a choice. I hope that the tides change in Texas and other places where meat trumps vegetables, and we can support small farmers who do their best to keep people, and themselves, healthy in more ways than one.",

I am a longtime vegetarian married to a (tolerant) omnivore and even though one thing we both love is Asian food and stir fries, I've never been able to cook good tofu and tempeh. But this technique has thankfully changed all that and I am really truly grateful! \n\nFor the benefit of others, here are some things that have worked for me:\n\n-A 7/10 is the perfect temp on my stove (which is NOT a Wolf or Viking or anything close to it).\n-Once you put the tofu in the hot oil, you HAVE to leave it alone for a couple minutes before turning or even checking. If you try to lift it before a crust has formed it will just tear off and stick to the pan and make a huge mess. \n-On that note, even though I don't use a nonstick skillet much in general I have found that it worked better here than my Le Creuset dutch oven. Just extra insurance against sticking. That said, I don't have my well-seasoned cast iron skillet with me this summer but I think it will work great and eliminate concerns about the nonstick pan.\n-Because I've been mainly been including this tofu in stir fries I've been cutting it in cubes and being pretty diligent about flipping every cube with a pair of tongs. That gets amazing results but is a lot of work, so I think I might switch to triangles.\n-Patting the cubes in cornstarch after drying and right before putting in the pan enhances the crust even further.\n\nA huge and sincere thank you to Michael and Andrea! I'd pretty much quit trying to cook tofu but now it's the best thing on the menu. Next up is an exploration of tempeh...",

      "content": "This tofu technique is genius. As a scientist (and vegan that lived in Japan), I can't believe I never heard of it before! I suspect that due to osmosis, the water molecules leave the tofu (especially from the surface in direct contact with the salted water) in order to dilute the salted water. The hot water would speed up the process. This is great because your tofu shouldn't get all salty which can happen if you try to use a salty marinade. I pretty much need to go try this right now but I don't have any tofu /(&gt;.&lt;)\\",

Cut and freeze what you don't use right away. The frozen part is great for baked tofu. \n\nAlso wanted to say I talked to a professor of food science who studies soy, and when I remarked that long marinating seemed to hold no edge over short marinating (despite what I always read), she said that there seems to be some component in soy that diminishes other flavor compounds over time, so long marinating really doesn't help. I have found that frozen sliced tofu, thawed and pressed (briefly, with my hands) absorbs marinade all the way through in no time. I just pour the marinade over and immediately bake it. Yum!",

The texture? Great. As Ilene states, it's nice and crispy on the outside but still soft in the inside. 2) They are still bland. I figured they would be flavorful due to the salt soaking in so I didn't prepare any sauces. Not the case. So either I didn't use enough salt in the boiling water (about 1 tsp) or you didn't mean to say \"freaking delicious\". 3) I need to find a place with fresh tofu, as you mentioned to see if this would even make a difference. Till then, I continue to marinate and dredge in my flour/nutritional yeast/bread crumb combo and fry/bake as usual. Regardless, thanks for the tip on how to make it crispy! I will look around your site for tasty sauce recipes. Bon apetit!",

      "content": "I heard a great tip recently to *broil* extra-firm tofu to get a crispy texture. I needed a way to make fried tofu without deep-frying. It's my favorite appetizer at Thai restaurants. One of the cooks suggested I try just using my broiler. Broiling has worked out great for me, instead of pan-frying which eliminates some oil and I have a glass-top stove and nonstick pans that make it hard to get right, like Michael explains here at the top. I buy Trader Joe's extra firm sprouted tofu twin-pack and slice it 3/8\" thick like Michael described , but slice again into little squares or rectangles. I lay the pieces on a lightly oiled -aluminum- baker's quarter sheet. A little sesame oil across the tops and place under the broiler for 5 mins on each side. They turn out a little curled and dried -but crispy!-, but that is all I was going for. It's great on salad or with thai chili sauce.",

Then Tofu Mom gave me the link to this page. After reading your post I felt like I could do that! \n\nI went to (the right) store and picked up my tofu and followed your instructions to the letter.

I always use it in recipes where it absorbs other flavors, like in lasagne or salad dressings.\n\nNow I have an easy way to enjoy tofu without \"making something.\"  My husband said it was good, too, but he didn't RAVE over it like I did.  I will DEFINITELY do this again.\n\nThe hot, salty water is a must, to flavor the tofu.  I think the salt also draws water out of the tofu making it firmer.  I used Firm (not Extra Firm) tofu, and I could tell a difference in firmness when I took it out of the water to pat it dry.\n\nThe only oil I had besides olive oil was coconut oil.  Don't know about the smoke point, but I know it can take higher heats than olive oil.  It DID start smoking about 3/4 of the way through.  My kitchen was a smoky mess and I had to open windows and doors, but it was WORTH IT.  The tofu was delicious!!!!\n\nThank you!!  So glad I tried this!",

Fry the tofu so that it \n\ncomes out golden brown on each side. Set aside.\n\nI slice and fry Shitake mushroom also in sesame oil (not too much). Set aside.\n\nHiziki, a japanese seaweed is prepared by first soaking in water until double in size, preferably over night. But an hour will do.\n\nIn olive oil, (quite plentiful) fry fresh garlic cloves (depending on the amount of Hiziki being prepared, the amount of garlic added depends on taste, at least 1 - 2 medium cloves. . Hiziki should be simmered at a low temperature so as not to burn. The idea is to let each strand of seaweed be caressed by the olive oil. When this has been done approximately 10 - 15 minutes. Shoyu soya is added and the Hiziki is simmered at low heat for at least 30 minutes. Until the Shoyu soya has soaked into the seaweed.\n\nDelicious warm or room temperature\n\nServing, as desired. On its own! With or without bread.\nOn a piece of sour dough bread alternatively hard Swedish bread place the tofu first, secondly place Shitake, top with Hiziki .... and finally top with finely chopped parsley.

Here is the question:  is the tofu puff in the soup actually crispy?  how can anything still be crispy after being in the soup?  if your tofu is only puffy but crispy is only in appearance, I can offer a suggestion. In cities like Toronto &amp; Vancouver  (in Canada) with huge Chinese markets, they sell tofu in dozens forms.  One form is simply called tofu puff, which was deep-fried, with almost all skin with very little inside. Cut up/diced/sliced and braised in soup will provide the texture of meat. Could that be what you are looking for? \nDeep fry soft tofu in high temperature briefly will give you a crispy exterior and silky interior,  Sprinkle seasoning of your choice, enjoy the best cheap snack.",

I have since moved and live in McDonough, Georgia, and ever so often I get a chance to go through Conyers. Well, I don't know what led me to the Silver Dragon - you probably guessed it to be an Asian restaurant, and you'd be right. It was there that I found the very best Salt and Black Pepper Tofu ever - ordered with my own special request \"spicy brown sauce\" - delish!!! The only problem is that SD isn't as clean as I'd like - the restroom reeks of crap, although I did get a peek into the kitchen and it was fairly clean - for a restaurant. Anyway, long story short, I haven't been in over a year and have tried to re-create the dish - so I am super excited to have come across Herbivoracious!!!! Thanks for everything!

Place the mixture in a thick layer at the bottom of n 8 inch springform pan , or or in thinner layers in the bottom of 2 nine - inch pie plates (this is what I do),or purchase a graham cracker crust. Set aside.\n\nNext start on the filling, make sure all ingredients are at room temperature. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.\n\nIn a food processor or blender, which ever you have, puree the tofu until smooth, add pumpkin, sugar, spices, soy cream cheese, lemon juice, and extract, process until smooth, make sure to scrape down the sides as you go along.\n\nAfter you've adjusted your sweetness and other flavors to your liking, pour the tofu mixture into the prepared pie crusts, and bake for about 50 minutes (depends on your oven), until the cheesecake is firm (we don't like ours extremely firm - but it still tastes great - you can't really even taste the pumpkin).\n\nNow, most importantly!!!! Turnoff the oven and leave the cheescake in the oven for 1 hour, afterwards remove it from the oven and then cool to room temperature. Then if you like refrigerate overnight, and serve slightly chilled. Now, this works for most, but in my family once i remove it from the oven - well it's a done deal - with a couple scoops of vanilla flavored soy ice cream, delish!!! And in all honesty I actually re-heat this delicious treat after it has been refrigerated -even better, please let me know how you it turn out and how you like it. Oh and I hope my instructions aren't confusing! Just let me know.",

Also using unsweetened soy milk as soup base for cream soup works well.  Add one pkg of plain gelatin in 2 cups of soy milk (sweetened or unsweetened), to make tofu pudding, fruit puree/berries/maple syrup etc. can be use as topping of unsweetened kind.  I believe more people will enjoy tofu if they accept tofu as tofu, not a substitute for something else (i.e. fake meat).  I have a suggestion for a salad: caprese salad using firm tofu top with a pesto dressing.  what do you think? A last suggestion, have you considered  using mango (ataulfo, can also be find in can pulp from India store) puree is place of pumpkin?",

Also, I totally understand about milk, I've been lactose intolerant for over 26 years now, so, I always find a substitute for dairy items. I've never tried a mango puree in place of the pumpkin but it sounds like a delightful idea - I'm open to it. Excellent idea for the salad, thanks - it's definitely doable for my family..I have to be careful with the tomatoes....I'll let you know how it turns out.",

The First time I did it the Tofu was so fantastic (Just make sure your marinade is the right strenght) and once dry fried you can freeze it or put it in the fridge (Flavorless) till your ready for your marinade..So along with the freezing method you get a tofu that will taste fantastic..Its a little tricky at first but once you get the hang of it (especially keeping the heat REALLY LOW!) You will never go back..Search for Dry Fry Tofu on google and there will be one website that has a lot of info and very detailed instructions..\nIm assuming its not popular cause people lack patients but once you get how to do it I just did large batches of it...You definatly can end up with fantastic tasting Tofu steaks!!",

Since soy sauce is very salty, would it give me the same effect? Or would I need to add salt to it as well? Also, the entire reason for thinking this, is would it impart any flavor (along with the crisp when fried) to the tofu, or is this thought just a waste of ingredients and time?\nThanks Michael,\nNicci",

I'm not up to starting from soy beans--not just yet, anyway. Anyone done that. My idea was to add herbs/spices at the beginning. (Have had zero success with marinades.) Also, will try the boiling salted water and the oven-baking methods. My favorite tofu supplier s Tung Woo, on the north side of Grand St just west of Bowery. Very close to the impressive Greek-columned bank that is now called Capitale. TW isn't a storefront as it doesn't even have a front. They just roll up the riot-shutter and there you have it--a cavernous space like a suburban 2car garage. Across the front is a simple counter. Behind it are a couple of iceboxes and lots of 5gallon plastic pails full of tofu.For a buck you can get 4 slabs of firm tofu, enough to fill a 1quart Chinese take-out carton (the old-fashioned kind with the wire handle). Almost all the customers are Chinese from the neighborhood, which suggests that it's good stuff, not just cheap.",
