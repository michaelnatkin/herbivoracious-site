      "content": "Michael,\n\nThe photo looks very tasty but I thought we'd already discussed the fact that you can deep fry ANYTHING, even a dismembered gorilla's anus, and it would taste good. And don't disparage deep fried gorilla anus; it's a delicacy in many cultures you ethnocentric dick.\n\nThere's just no way around the natural law that tempeh sucks ass. In fact, tempeh's shitiness is even stronger than gravity because unlike the law of gravity, the law of tempeh sucking ass holds true even at the subatomic level.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Friend the Surly Motherfucking Gourmand",

      "content": "For people who think that tempeh will never taste as good as fried gorilla anus, I normally deep-fry some and serve it with a stripe of ketchup and a couple of dots of mayo, this changes their tune pretty quickly (though they never quite lose the pucker, must be their diet).",

      "content": "i love tempeh! It's something I love to make any time as a meal accompaniment since it's great with tofu, vegetables, ANYTHING. \n\nHave to agree that cooking-style wise, tempeh's only got a good fry going for it, but after that the possibilities are endless. I love it fried\n\n...with a little salt and it goes well with mee goreng (had it just yesterday!)\n...with a little cumin and spice and goes well as a veggie/tofu burger alternative \n...and stir fried with a little tofu in a spicy sambal sauce or chilli paste. ;)\n\nyour recipe with lemongrass sounds great and I can't wait to add it as a staple to my weeknight dinners!",
