      "content": "Your comments, I feel, are at the heart of why cooking is an applied science: one cannot explore all the possibilities by trial-and-error to create something in the real world.  A bit like engineering.  What I find so interesting is that while science has figured out something about the texture of food and its chemical components, very little is known about flavors and how they combine.\n\nI have been enjoying the posts on your site and I hope you will continue writing even after your sabbatical is up.",

      "content": "This is absolutely hysterical. Or terrifying. I can't really say which right now.\n\nAs I am testing certain baked good over and over for a large scale commercial baking enterprise in London, it's an amazing thing you've said here.\n\nWe are trying to hit in on the fourth turn of each change. Working in grams and having a lot of mouths makes the process easier.",
