      "content": "I made these this morning and they are the best banana-based muffins I've had. You know how banana bread is pretty good, but the whole time you're eating it, it just shouts BANANA! In your mouth? What sets this recipe apart is the complement of favors from - duh, let's start with less banana...then there's the brightness of the fresh ginger, the depth from brown sugar instead of white, the buttermilk which adds its own sweetness. What really sent these over the top was just that little bit of caramel drizzle after baking. I've had two already. Bliss!",
