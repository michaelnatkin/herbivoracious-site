      "content": "Sounds REALLY good. It also reminds me of a favorite at our house -- from \"The James Beard Celebration,\" a recipe for Crepes aux Duxelles: basically it's a lot like yours, except that instead of chocolate filling and a sweet crepes, you make the crepes batter without sugar, and between crepe layers you put duxelles -- the result of cooking down finely-chopped mushrooms until they almost start to dry out. As with yours, the edges are a little messy, but wedge-shapes slices look great. Garnished with a drizzling of rich reduced stock and a few leaves of parsley, they make a great first course.",
