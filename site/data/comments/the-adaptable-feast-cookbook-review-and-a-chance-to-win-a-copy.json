Of course, that's why I read your blog, Micheal, and the blogs of other vegetarians.\n\nOh! Thanks for the \"introduction\" to Ivy Manning. I've started following her on Twitter. I follow you and a few other vegetarians, too. Does that make me a veggie-stalker? Hmmm. ;-)",

It's also focused on meals that have a meat/fish and a veg component, and there are some really innovative flavor combinations. It transformed the way I look at tofu - it had never really occurred to me that tofu could be combined with flavors from all different cultures, not just Asian ones.\n\nCongratulations to Ivy - the new book sounds great!",
