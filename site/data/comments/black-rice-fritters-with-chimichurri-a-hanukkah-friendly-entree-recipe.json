      "content": "Sigh, I know you put the capers and cilantro in your chimichurri but those items are really not used in Argentina for Chimichurri. My family there does not ever use cilantro. Or capers! Some of them will add the oregano if they have it and crushed red pepper is a must. That being said, I am going to try this with brown rice because I have it!  Then I will look for black rice.",

The colors and flavors here are so lovely, I'm looking forward to mixing up the latke tradition with these this year!  The other Hanukkah meal I make annually is this decadent french toast: http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/dining/091arex.html?ref=dining :)",
