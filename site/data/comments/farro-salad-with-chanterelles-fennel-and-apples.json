Is Acetoria a brand name? I settled on an apple vinegar (Aceto di Mele, L'Arentino), and it was very light colored. Your sauce/dressing looks darker in the picture above.",

      "content": "Hey Bruce - glad you liked that combination! Yes, Acetoria is a brand name; I used to get it from ChefShop.com but they don&#39;t seem to have it anymore, which is a shame - the stuff is brilliant. I think you might be able to make a substitute by reducing apple cider vin, apple juice, and some sugar together until it is syrupy.",
