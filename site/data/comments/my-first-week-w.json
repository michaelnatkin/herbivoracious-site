      "content": "Michael,\n\nI applaud you.  You are very courageous.\n\nI am struggling with very similar issues about making a career change and you have given me some inspiration.\n\nI have started letting my culinary creative juices flow via my blog http://karmafreecooking.wordpress.com.\n\nHopefully I'll get the courage, as you did, to take a leave of absence and try it out.  There's interest in vegetarianism in Puerto Rico and a true need for education and catering/dining alternatives.\n\nLet's see what the future holds for both of us.\n\nExito!!!!",
