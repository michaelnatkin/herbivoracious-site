      "content": "Superb. My whole family is somewhat licorice-negative, and we tend to downplay tarragon, but I decided to go with this recipe just as written. We all loved it, and found the balance of flavors just perfect. Some of the licorice-ness of tarragon (and some kinds of basil) seems to go away with puree-ing, for reasons I don't understand but do appreciate. I skipped the finishing salt, since the gorgonzola was already moderately salty. I also brought the Gorgonzola to room temp by shoving it in the microwave for about 7 seconds, which also softened it a bit to make it easier to spread (and dealt with the problem of my not having read through the recipe before I started!). I'd like to try something similar with rosemary, although probably a lot LESS rosemary, and no actual leaves on the crostini. I also think that this is the rare appetizer that could go really well with a Sauternes. I may have to try that shortly -- there was a big demand for a repeat of this recipe.",

      "content": "Nice! I use the microwave trick for tempering cheese sometimes too, if I haven't had the malice aforethought to bring it to room temperature the old fashioned way. Sauternes sounds nice although I might also think of a very dry, minerally Riesling. Oh wait, that's what I like to drink with everything.",
