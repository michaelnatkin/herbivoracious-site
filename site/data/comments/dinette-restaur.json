      "content": "That is a very \"reasonable\" point! Seattle is expensive of course. By reasonable I really mean that I'm getting at least what I expected for the price, so it is a relative term. A $20 dinner or a $300 dinner could both be reasonable. For dinner for two with drinks, appetizer, entree, maybe dessert, tax, and tip I guess I think roughly in these terms:\n\n$0 - $25: downright cheap, and I'm expecting minimal atmosphere, and tasty food but nothing surprising\n\n$25 - $50: low-end, I'm expecting some sort of fun atmosphere, maybe a pub, and food prepared with some care but nothing special\n\n$50 - $80: getting up there, I'm expecting quality service and food that tastes at least as good as what I can easily whip up myself\n\n$80 - $120: everything should be spot on\n\n$120 - infinity - needs to be a truly special experience",
