I'm a culinary student at South Seattle Community College, and as part of our final project we have to conceptualize and open a restaurant on paper. I realized that my carnivorous teammates managed to pack the menu without a single vegetarian option. Would you mind if we used this recipe? Obviously, we wouldn't be making any money off of it. Thank you!",
