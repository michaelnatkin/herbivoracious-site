      "content": "This was quite good but it was really missing the ginger added to the first spice blend as in the original recipe. In almost every dal recipe either ginger or hing (asafoetida) is added in part as a \"digestive.\" Hing is superfunky raw, (the Germans call it devil's dung) but completely changes in character to indescribably delicious when a small amount hits the hot oil in the tempering. It also subs for garlic in puritanical Jain cuisine, as garlic and onions are thought to inflame base desires.\n\nI'm lucky to live a few blocks away from an Indian spice store so I'm able to easily get black cardamom, which has a different smokier character than regular green cardamom , which subs nicely, however, in this recipe.\n\nI'm not a vegetarian, but I think I could live rather happily (and cheaply) on dal and rice exclusively with so many delicious varieties of flavors and textures developed to perfection over thousands of years on the Subcontinent.\n\nThis recipe is definitely a keeper, and much easier to make than it appears initially. \n\nThanks!",
