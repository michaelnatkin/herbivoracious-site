      "content": "I have to ask since i have never used agar-agar in the kitchen... where do you get it for use at home? is it pretty much flavor-free? As a microbiologist who has worked with agar gels a LOT in the lab, i cant imagine using it in my kitchen! Although i suppose the horrid smell of agar gels in the lab are from the yeast extracts and such that are added to the agar. Still i am curious... does it add its own flavor/taste/smell to the food?",

There are some agar-agar&#39;s on the market that have a bit of a seaweed smell, but most are pretty flavorless and odorless. A good Japanese grocery will have several. Some are pre-mixed with sugar and some are plain. I prefer to work with the plain so I can control the sweetness, but sugar probably helps with dispersion.",
