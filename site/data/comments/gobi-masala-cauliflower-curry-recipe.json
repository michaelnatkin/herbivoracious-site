      "content": "I make a closely-related version of this dish, but it also includes cubed potatoes, and getting the potatoes and cauliflower to be done at the same time is a little tricky at first.\n\nThe key ingredient that I use and you don't is nigella seeds -- about 10-20 seeds for a dish that serves 4 seems about right. They have a flavor that goes perfectly with the cauliflower. You can throw them in at the same time as the mustard seeds. (I get them from a local indian store; I think my 8oz bag cost me about what one 3/4oz Spice Islands jar of cumin would cost!)\n\nMy only other suggestion is that it's good idea to add the mustard oil LATE in the process. High heat seems (to me) to make it lose its mustardy-ness.",

      "content": "Hey Ivy - You can find mustard oil at any Indian grocery, but it will likely be labeled for external use only. You have to use your own judgement on that one. Apparently the US has banned it as a cooking oil and labeling it that way is wink to get around it. I haven&#39;t studied it extensively, but figure I&#39;m willing to take the chance on a teaspoon here and there. You are probably right that it should be refrigerated if you don&#39;t use it often.",

That said, there are some reputable brands of spice mixes that are quite good. Your best bet is to buy them at a busy Indian grocer where they will have turned over quickly and so not turned to dust on the shelf.",

Do some reading on the web and make your own decision whether you want to use it or not. Asafoetida can be found at any Indian grocery, or you can buy it online:\u00a0<a href=\"http://amzn.to/gOJsGB\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amzn.to/gOJsGB</a> . It is used in very small quantities, and it adds somewhat of garlicky, resinous flavor, and is purported to be good for digestion.",

It is worth finding the black mustard seed though, it it a different flavor and used in a huge number of Indian dishes so you won't have any trouble using it up.",

It's quite potent and it seems I have a lifetime supply if all I need is a pinch at a time.  What I like about this recipe is how easy it is to make as the only perishable ingredient I need is the cauliflower.  (I omitted the fresh cilantro garnish and I always have onions on hand.)  Thank you for providing a new and delicious way to eat cauliflower!",
