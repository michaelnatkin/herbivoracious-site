      "content": "We had chimichurri with roasted vegetables on our recent trip to Argentina. Funnily, that was the only time I had chimichurri in the country, and I had to specifically ask for it! I guess because chimichurri is typically served with meat, my vegetarian orders never came with chimichurri.\n\nI love the intensity of the ingredients here, I bet it tasted great with polenta. Youve created a beautiful plate here.",

I'd often request it along side my pizza, which made a pretty delicious combination, but I think polenta might be an even better idea now that I'm back to my own kitchen. Good thinkin!",

Olive oil, parsley, garlic, and chopped serrano chilis. I swear it's the most delicious thing ever... the heat of the chilis is a surprise because you don't expect it.",

Which kinda cracks me up.\n\nThey also do olives in the chimichurri... different types of olives mixed in with the sauce. Since the olives are whole, it's hard to eat them but ever so easy to pick out the olives and snack on them, and spread the remaining sauce on bread.",

It is a powerful flavor, so I'd avoid using it with something that has a subtle flavor that you don't want to obliterate.",

      "content": "In Argentina they never use cilantro or capers. This is an alteration from Bobby Flay I think. Cilantro is not indigenous to Argentina. And while I will sometimes chop it in a food processor, I never add the oil until everything is chopped and in my vessel or jar. And in Argentina it is very garlicky so add half a head of garlic instead of 1 clove. Onion is optional! My mother in law would not be caught dead putting onion in her chimichurri. But an Aunt puts a small amount in.  Everyone adds crushed red pepper flakes and fresh oregano is common but I don't use it.",

Very delicious.\nHowever I make it often just like your recipe and we love it so much. Great on grilled bread and many other uses for it. It's always in my refrigerator. Try mixing in Basil and spread on roasted tomatoes or re peppers on mozzeral. So may things can be made with this. Enhoy",
