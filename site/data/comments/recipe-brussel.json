      "content": "I add onions, chopped, about 3/4 cups, finely chopped, and add it, after step 4, then add 1/2 tsp ground ginger or 1tsp ginger- garlic paste, and a pod of red chilli,broken into bits. I don't like the sweet flavor, so no brown sugar. 1 tsp of lime juice at the very end, adds flavor",
