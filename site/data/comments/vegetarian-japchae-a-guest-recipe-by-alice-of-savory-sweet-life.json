      "content": "I made this dish yesterday for one on my clients. FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe exactly as written (which I rarely do) as my wok skills are still at a novice level. I really liked the strong technique given here and I actually learned a lot, particularly adding the 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil to each ingredient after cooking. Genius! It makes all the difference. Also loved the note to MASSAGE the cooked spinach, which I thought was a misprint, until I did it!\n\nI love Michael and now I love you too, Alice!",

      "content": "This posting was doubly good -- it inspired me to try making Jap Chae, which I've always liked, and ALSO to look at Alice's blog, adding several more recipes to my \"gotta try that soon\" list.\n\nThe Jap Chae was great. I made too many noodles (we had a gang of kids over, so I got a big bag...which turned out not to be divided into \"piles\", and I ended up making it all. Probably 3 times as much as I should have, but it worked out fine. When I was buying it, the Asian market also had some lovely baby bok choy; we rinsed them thoroughly, sliced off the very bottom, sliced the white part about 1/4\" thick, and threw the leaves in with the spinach leaves. I then boiled the spinach/boy choy greens for 1 min, and then the white parts of the bok/choy for about 90 seconds. Worked out great!\n\nMy kids helped do the prep, the stir-frying (two pans, since we were doing a double-batch), and, of course, the eating. Big hit with EVERYone.\n\nMy only thought when I was done was that I'm not certain what you meant by \"two stalks\" of green onions. I figured you meant \"two green onions\", and that was OK. But I think I'd have liked it better if it had been two BUNCHES of green onions. (My wife disagrees, though.)",

Definitely would have been better with onions, but it was still great without. I added a few extra of the other veggies, plus some savoy cabbage, and a minced ghost pepper, because I like it hot.\n\nWe also made your banchan alongside and LOVED the way they counterpointed the dish.\n\nThe only thing I wish was more clear in the recipe is a measurement on the noodles. \"One bundle\" is not a proper measurement. The only noodles I was able to get came in one 12 oz. package, no bundles. I ended up enlarging the photo of the ingredients and guesstimating how many noodles were there.",
