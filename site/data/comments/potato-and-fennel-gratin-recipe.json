      "content": "Excellent recipe Michael! I also added a bit of Dijon mustard along with some ouzo from my liquor cabinet! I also used 1 cup of half & half with some vegetable stock instead of 2 cups of heavy cream for less fat. I don't think the flavor was compromised one bit! I didn't boil the potatoes either. I just sliced them and sauteed them in some vegetable broth. Excellent flavor!",
