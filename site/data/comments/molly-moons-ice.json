I would make a trip out to Seattle specifically for this ice cream...\nThis morning I received a blog award and thought I would pass it on to you. Nothing tangible but, for me, cyberspace appreciation is always nice. (Can you tell this was my first award?)\nNatasha",

It's served in Olympia at a few local spots and it's by far the best and most creative ice cream I've ever had.  Keep an eye out in Seattle and you'll likely find it.  The Internet says that it's served at <a href=\"http://seattle.about.com/od/fooddining/fr/palisade.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Palisade</a>, <a href=\"http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/111350_rest07.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chinook's</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.arniesrestaurant.com/Edmonds/desserts.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arnie's</a>.

      "content": "Thanks for the comments!  I gotta get in there soon and try those toppings.  The new cherry flavor is pretty much mind blowing (in my humble opinion).  Maybe its the power of suggestion now, but the salted caramel was a bit homogeneous.  I think that flavor would be much better with an unbalanced sweet and saltiness to it.\n\nThe homemade waffle cones are incredible too.  Keep up the good blogging...",
