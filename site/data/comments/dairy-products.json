      "content": "Israel also produces a Buffalo yogourt and some very fine goat cheeses. If you are in the Mahane Yehuda market, there are a few very fine cheese shops. For the largest and most incredible selection of imported cheeses, check out Basher on Etz Hayyim Street corner of HaAgas. To help you find places in the shuq, check out my map of Mahane Yehuda at http://israeltours.wordpress.com/2008/05/31/mahane-yehuda-the-market/\nShmuel",
