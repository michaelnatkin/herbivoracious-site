      "content": "I've used whole annato seeds by infusing them in oil over low heat ... works pretty well.  I've tried to then pulverize them in a mortar and pestle and gotten it reasonably smooth-- the seeds are very hard and don't really become smooth, though the color and flavor infuse into the oil.  There's probably some way to do it, you might see if Diana Kennedy talks about it.",

      "content": "Wow does that look yummy! I have worked with Achiote paste before and my all time fav is Del Mayab.  I have used it with many meals, one of favorites is marinating tempeh in it and stir frying it up with some sweet peppers and onions and serving as fajitas.  Haven't done that in a long time. Might have to give it a try again!\nDana Zia\nhttp://danazia.wordpress.com/",

      "content": "Hi, Michael. I found you through Cookthink and can't wait to try this recipe over the weekend - it sounds delicious. I used achiote paste for the first time recently and wasn't happy with the additional seasonings, so I was thinking of making my own in a spice grinder next time. If the seeds don't simply break the grinder, I'll let you know if it was successful.",
