Also, I think I was spending as much on seltzer as your family, and it's just me and the cat.  And he doesn't drink seltzer.  Beyond the expense, I also kept filling up the recycle and kept thinking \"There is no way I will ever buy enough polar fleece in my lifetime to recycle all of this plastic.\"\n\nMy only problem: altho I too I am in Seattle and in the delivery area, I cannot get them to pick up the bottles for the last 3-4 deliveries. I now have 7 empties. The folks on the phone are very nice but no one can seem to get this to work now when it used to work great.  Actually calling them again now...",
