      "content": "We faked this entirely, left out the lettuce, subbed mango for watermelon, added mushrooms, and didn't grill (used a grill pan on the stove), and it still came out wonderfully.  Very inspirational, and a really great salad that works well as leftovers (if you leave out the lettuce, nothing to get soggy!).\n\nThank you!!",

I had never had watermelon in that context, but it just seems to belong now, just as easily as it does on a hot summer picnic in big, juicy wedges. I'll bookmark this sure.",

I love your site (just happily stumbled upon it) and I made this salad several times - throwing in different fruits like mangos, peaches etc. it doesn't really matter - it all works with the lovely dressing.\nSince I'm living in Europe, there's no Trader Joe available here, but your dressing is wonderful!\nThanks!",
