      "content": "Hey Emma - I don't think it is going to work with portabellos. They will just keep throwing off water and fight getting crispy. The king oysters don't have that tendency, plus they have this vertical orientation to their \"grain\" that makes a good texture. Where do you live? King oysters are often available at Whole Foods, and at Asian groceries, especially those that have a lot of Korean ingredients.",

I'm going to try with the oyster mushrooms now!",

Today I took them out, patted them dry and put them in a baking pan coated with olive oil - mixed them around some and baked them at 400 degrees.  Added a little cumin, cinnamon and black pepper.  Results were tasty and many pieces were pretty crisp.  Had them with some left over sweet potato/spicy tofu dumplings  Yum.  Could see using them in many different ways  - a topping for salads or soups, in other dishes, and on a veggie avocado BLT type sandwich!",
