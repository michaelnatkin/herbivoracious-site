      "content": "For those in NYC, I have seen dumpling presses at M2M on 3rd ave between 10th and 11th.  One thing I've noticed with mandoo, however, is that the wrapper/skin tends to be thicker than other dumplings--which I think sets mandoo apart.  Do you have any suggestions for brand that has a thicker wrapper, or perhaps a recipe for one?",

I'm sure it is on there somewhere, but the top few ingredients should certainly be soybeans, chilis and wheat. Oh, here's a pic of the box I managed to google: http://www.meilengloh.com/?p=248",
