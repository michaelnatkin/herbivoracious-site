      "content": "Bibimbap is not only my favorite Korean dish, but it's also my current favorite comfort food. We're lucky to have a big Korean population in this area of NJ and the local restaurant makes an amazing Dolsot Bibimbap. ALthough, they call it Gob Dol Bibimbap, not sure of the reason for the difference. Is there a specific brand of Kochujang that you use? I have yet to try making bibimbap myself, but this recipe is inspiring.",

      "content": "First of all, thanks for the recipe! I'm a Korean and it's actually rare to prepare Bibimbap like this - we usually just mix whatever's leftover. \nRegarding good quality gochujang, they do sell authentic ones in Korea that are made with least ingredients and that have been fermented properly. But outside Korea, it's probably hard to come across. You can make your own though! My mom makes her own most of the time. \np.s. adding thinly sliced, toasted nori sheets to bibimbap is awesome :)",

I always loved the contrasts of temperatures--the cooler rice with the hot egg--but I've also been seduced by the crispy rice at the bottom of what our local restaurant calls \"GopDol Bibimbap.\" \n\nWe make versions of it now as \"rice bowls\" at home. It's a great option with picky family members if done on an assembly line. I fry the eggs to order.",
