      "content": "While not traditionally Indian, this is definitely a great Indian-inspired recipe.\n\nOn a slightly related note, I've been making Indian tacos for years, but unfortunately there are too many carnivores in the world for my vegetarian Indian tacos to really take off.  Sigh.",

      "content": "I love dry fried Indian dishes! yum! We got started cooking them from a cookbook called Indian Vegetarian Cooking from an American Kitchen.\n\nAs for Indian Tacos, we have them here in New Mexico, they're just different, made by Native Americans and with big lumps of fry bread. Completely different flavors but called the same thing. But since I am GF, I haven't tasted them.\n\nFor a gluten free Indian Taco, I would make some dosa or idli's and put this in them with some yogurt.",
