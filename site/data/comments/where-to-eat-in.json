They serve lunch in one big room, and are very vegetarian friendly. I think the veggie meal was better than the meat eaters' meal.\n\nAlso, if you see a Grom you must eat their gelato. They recently received a lot of press as they opened an store in NYC, but this is by far the best gelato you'll find anywhere in the world.",
