I think it would pair well with this coconut rice (<a href=\"https://herbivoracious.com/2009/03/coconut-rice-recipe.html).\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://herbivoracious.com/2009/03/coconut-rice-recipe.html).</a> Another option would be to have it as part of an anti-pasto, maybe with a different dressing.

      "content": "I made this two days ago, at the other end of the season. It's been warm in New England and my garden's not yet frozen (until tonight!). That meant I harvested the last 2 dozen purple haze carrots, a bit of very chilly dill, and some similarly chilly caraway for garnish. I bought the radishes. I cut the carrots into pieces about 3/8\" square x 5\" long. Blanching them made them lose some of their lovely purple color, but otherwise it was a lovely dish. The leftovers were even MORE lovely this morning -- the purple of the carrots had seeped into the oil of the dressing to produce an almost scarlet color on everything. \n\nAnyhow...a big success. Next time, with late-season carrots, I'd probably use the microwave to cook them to avoid losing color. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.",
