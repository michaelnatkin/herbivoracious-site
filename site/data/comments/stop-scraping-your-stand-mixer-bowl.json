Kitchen Aid will not value the warranty if a blade like this is used so a lot of stores are not carrying them anymore.  It is too bad because I have one and love it!!!  Although it does seem to make the motor have to work extra hard on thick doughs.  The other theory is that kitchen aid wants to make thier own.",
