      "content": "I like fried rice, especially fried with curry, but the pinapple is not for me, sorry....\n\nfor some reason I cannot eat any savory dish with pineapple in it :-)\n\nI used to make this often a few years ago because I had a Chinese store nearby that sold vegetarian fake meat and fish, and they had vegetarian prawns!!!\n\nThey were pink, looked like prawns, a bit chewy and tasted like salted water...but they were fun and perfect for a red curry fried rice!!!\n\nBut they don't sell them anymore...not enough vegetarian around here I guess...",
