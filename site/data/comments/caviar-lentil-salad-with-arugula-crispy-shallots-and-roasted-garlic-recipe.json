      "content": "What a beautiful presentation this salad made on the plate, and it is so good.  I did not have shallots but I pulled a couple of onions from my garden and harvested a bowl of yellow volunteer cherry tomatoes.  I was also short on oil and only had olive oil so I cooked thinly sliced onion in batches and followed your guidelines for how to cook and crisp the onion.  wow! Best onions I have ever made.  I had to use white balsamic vinegar but that was actually really good.  I can definitely serve this for guests as a middle course with perhaps a soup as appetizer and a nice dessert.  What are your thoughts on substitutions?",
