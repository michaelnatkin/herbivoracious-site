      "content": "Hi Michael.........greetings from New Zealand :)\n\nCould I please ask if this could be made the day before, stored in the fridge, then re-heated the next day...??   If so is the microwave the better option.  Going to a friends Moroccan Themed Dinner Party and we are all bringing one main and one starter or side dish.   I won't have much time on the day, so if it reheats well........this one looks a real winner.  Thank you Michael",
