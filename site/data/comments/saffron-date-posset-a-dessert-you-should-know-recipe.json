Like Maria above, I can't in good conscience consume that much cream in one sitting...too much cholesterol for me! So, I'm making mine with a combination of coconut cream and almond milk and will use either xantham gum or agar agar as a thickener.\n\n(Probably agar agar because it's way more fun to say.)",

I had some separation when I first made it so I reheated it and added some sodium citrate as an emulsifier. That made it a little salty so I added the toasted coconut as a sweet counterpoint.\n\nUltimately, I used 325g of almond milk and one tin of coconut cream (note that it's cream and not milk!) with 2 g of agar agar and 10 g of sodium citrate. (It's the sodium citrate level that I think needs tweaking.) With those amounts, the yield was four servings.\n\nNow that I know it works, I can pick up the ingredients for the saffron-date pudding!",

      "content": "Hey Jen -\n\nSo I checked with Chris Young, and he asked an interesting question. Does your coconut cream have any added stabilizers, likely some type of gum? It is possible they are incompatible with the agar and that might have caused the initial breaking you saw. Also, did you use the citric acid from the original recipe too, or no?\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

      "content": "I've binned the tin now so can't answer the first question. In retrospect, I was also wondering if the separation might have been caused by the coconut solids coming out of suspension because the agar agar wasn't setting quickly. \n\nI did not use the citric acid as there was no dairy &amp; I assumed the citric acid was modifying the dairy proteins. (That assumption may or may not have any foundation in reality...LOL)",

I'd guess the syrup might just work as is, maybe reducing the amount of cream slightly to offset the additional liquid. You could always try making a half or quarter batch first to see how it goes. If you do it, let us know how it works out!",
