      "content": "Looks great. The Shiitake mushrooms seem like a terrific balance to the sprout flavor. \n\nA friend of ours does something similar with sprouts, but she slices the sprouts perpendicular to the axis into about 3/16-inch \"slabs\" (which tend to fall apart) and then does browns them the way you do. The greater area from the thinner slicing means more surface to brown (good), but it also requires a larger pan/heat source, or multiple batches: you want to brown them without making the non-browned parts end up all limp and mushy.",

      "content": "Darn right smoked paprika is a pantry staple! Especially for a vegetarian or vegan; omnivores have an easier time finding smoky flavors in smoked meats (and cheese).\n\nI've been roasting brussels sprouts and eating them regularly ever since I found this recipe a few years ago. (http://www.101cookbooks.com/archives/goldencrusted-brussels-sprouts-recipe.html) Before that, I'd only had them boiled; it blew my mind.\n\nI'll have to give this preparation a try next time. Thanks.",

      "content": "Lovely recipe. I'm actually getting excited here thinking about cooking brussels sprouts with smoked paprika. As a sprouts lover and smoked paprika addict who tries to sneak it into everything, I'm amazed I've never tried it before.  Definitely agreed that it should be in everybody's pantry. A few years ago, when it was harder to find, I brought about 5 tins of the stuff home from a trip to Barcelona. Still, I never got tired of it.",

Gotta give my husband credit for coming up with the idea when I told him I wish they had a crash course for veganism (I went omnivore to vegan overnight due to health issues).\n\nYou're right, Vegetarian Blowtorch would have been a good one. :)  I'm particularly keen on herbivacious though!",
