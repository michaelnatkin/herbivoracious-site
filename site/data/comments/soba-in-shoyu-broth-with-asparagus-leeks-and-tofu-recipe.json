      "content": "I had lunch at NW Tofu once but didn't buy a pound to take home. I'll have\nto try it. I really like the tofu from Thanh Son Tofu on 12th between Yesler\nand Fir as well. It is fairly firm and yet really creamy and flavorful. They\nalso offer a few varieties of pre-deep-fried puffs, which are great, and\nfresh soymilk. For this recipe I like the silken/soft tofu, which Thanh Son\ndoesn't have. Do you know if NW does? It would be great to have a local\nsource for that.\n\np.s. thanks for the tip on the Ipod repair (on twitter)",

I know what I usually do in my free time (and I assume you probably have an overabundance of it) is troll and lurk on blogs waiting to leave my little treats of discontent anywhere I might find an idea, or way of thinking that doesn't coexsist with mine, or challenges the very fiber of my existence (and no I wouldn't say a recipe for soba noddles should normally provide such a life challenge - but in those rare human cases of single celled exsistence I could see how something so \"different\" might be frightening or enraging).  You really have shown us 'pussies' a thing or two, and for that I am thankful! My life is now more enriched and elevated by your exlimation of defiance.  Well, I have to go.. it seems I have some lives to shatter with my personal and dietary choices.  Look out Texas, I'm aiming high!",
