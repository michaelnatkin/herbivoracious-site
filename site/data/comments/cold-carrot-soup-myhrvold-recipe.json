To stay on the safe side I cooked at the lower pressure setting and for just 15 minutes.  There was a significant level of caramelization afterwards, so I can only imagine how much you had.  The result was delicious, and I'll definitely try it again in other shapes/forms and with the longer caramelization.  I'm thinking beets will be next because of the sugar content/color.\n\nThanks as always for the inspiration!",

There can be no unnecessary ingredient or unnecessary step.

Keep in mind that water expands about 1700 x in volume when it becomes steam, so even the small amount of water in the carrots seems to be plenty to bring the pressure cooker up to full pressure and maintain the temperature. I&#39;m also using a thermostatically controlled electric pressure cooker. I can&#39;t say exactly what the experience would be on a stovetop model, but on mine, the pressure indicator came all the way up and stayed up throughout the cooking.",

      "content": "I tried this last night (as well as several of Michael's other recipes, as an anniversary dinner). I suffered the \"carrot-glaze-sticking-to-the-bottom-and-burning\" phenomenon, but I think it was mostly my own fault: I misinterpreted \"high pressure\" for \"keep the heat on the whole time\" (my cooker's old-style: just a simple weight on the top, which establishes the pressure). I think that if I'd done it the way that's more natural for me (heat until the weight jiggle violently, then back off the temp control until the little light JSUT goes out) it might have worked out fine. Anyhow, by avoiding scraping anything black off the bottom, I got wonderful mushy and partly caramelized carrots out; the resulting flavor was very similar to that of a top-notch well-spiced pumkin pie, oddly. (This is in contrast to Michael's version: mine were definitely darker in color when done, and not at all \"essence of carrot\", but instead something richly transformed. So maybe that whole accidental over-browing wasn't such a bad thing!)\n\nI \"pureed\" in my Cuisinart. Passing the stuff through the sieve was essentially pointless -- nothing remained behind, because it was already silky smooth.\n\nThe collection of \"additions\" was great. I made the shallots by slicing (1/16\" thick?) a shallot, adding about 2t of rice-wine-vinegar (it was what I had handy) and microwaving for 30 second. The flavor was great, the light pink color contrasted nicely with the dark orange of the soup, and it blended well with the pomegranate and dukkah flavors.\n\nOverall: a winner, but I think you have to know your own pressure cooker. Next time, I might try using the stovetop model that has the nonstick lining. (I was a little pressed for stovetop spacewith all the other stuff I was preparing!)",

The recipe in the book is a bit more complicated, calling for centrifuged carrot juice and carotene butter... but the biggest difference is that the Modernist Cuisine recipe calls for adding 0.5% Baking soda (by weight of the carrots).  The addition of the baking soda promotes browning and the development of complex caramelized carrot flavor.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what you come up with next!",

      "content": "Thanks Michael, for your variation on the recipe.\n\nI do have Modernist Cuisine. The way Myhrvold and coauthors praise the benefits of the pressure cooker prompted me to buy one (a \"fagor duo\").\n\nI was, as many others, about cooking in it without water. It seems contrary to everything I know about them.\n\nThe Modernist recipe calls for butter in enough amount that the bottom was covered with it, which eased my concerns. I closed it, and followed the recipe instructions (the errata of the book calls for 20 minutes, not the originally 50).\n\nI was careful, though. I let it in hot until the steam started flowing, then lowered it to the point that steam kept flowing (gas stove). Nothing burned, but perfectly cooked carrots.\n\nOf course I can't centrifuge juice, so I added it \"as is\", nonetheless.\n\nNext time I'll try your variation.\n\nHopefully my experience with a stove top will ease some other home cooks and get them to try it.\n\n--dmg",

Dr. Myhrvold gave me permission to post the MC recipe as a correction here, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to it. If anyone who doesn&#39;t have MC wants it, add a comment here and I&#39;ll make it a priority!",

      "content": "Indeed, you can speed up Maillard reactions by raising pH (which is why adding a small amount of baking soda helps). It also tends to make things go mushy, which is fine when you are going to puree them (and terrible otherwise :). It doesn't seem to be necessary in this dish though, the carrots caramelize and maillard-ize quite nicely on their own.",
