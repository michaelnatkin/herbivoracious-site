      "content": "First of all, a MILLION congrats on your little addition!! Way to go!\n\nSecond, I am in love with your chocolate descriptions. HUGE chocolate fan here. \"Smoky Blue, with Rogue River smoky blue cheese and chipotle\" OMG!!! I'd be ALL over this! Well, except for the fact that I really try to stick to the plain, dark (and thus usually vegan)varities.\n\nI do have to say Guittard is my favorite chocolate company because they make the absolute BEST semi-sweet chips for cookies and they're easily available in regular ol' Safeway - sadly I live far from any \"interesting\" markets... AND the Guittard chips? they're \"accidently\" vegan. Score.",
