      "content": "Last summer I made a similar dish with manouri cheese instead of ricotta, and I used shimeji instead of shiitake. The soup stock is build on a Japanese style konbu-based dashi with porcini to provide a more katsuo-like flavor than dried shiitake offer. I'm terrible at beggar's purses, so I  just made a sort of ravioli.\n\nhttp://blog.jagaimo.com/archive/2007/07/08/mustard-greens-and-manouri-cheese-ravioli.aspx\n\nIt's been a while since I've been to Cafe Flora. Trying your ravioli variation sounds like a good excuse!",
