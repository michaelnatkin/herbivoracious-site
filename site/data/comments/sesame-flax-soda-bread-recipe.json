      "content": "I started measuring internal temperature of my breads and it makes a difference. If nothing else, it's a lot less awkward than getting a hot loaf of bread out of the pan, rapping on the bottom and then putting it back if it's not done. \n\nHave you tried the Thermapen yet? Worth it?",

      "content": "Love the ease and convenience of soda breads compared to yeast breads, though both bave their own place and time.\nGlad to see you did not name it \"Irish\" Michael :) Because, just the other day, I was reading about traditional Irish breads and how there is no butter, no eggs, no sugar or anything else.\n\nReally liked the part where you explain how a kind of bread works with something and not the other. I tend to grinding flax seeds as required before use.",
