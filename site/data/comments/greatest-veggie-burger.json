There have been great double blind studies that show that the people that think they are affected by it are simply experiencing a placebo effect.

      "content": "You are right, it is great to look at the peer reviewed medical literature. And if you look at every single study that has been done correctly (double blind, placebo controlled, and with the MSG given in a gelatin capsule so the tasters can't tell whether they are getting MSG or the placebo), there has been no observed effect. For example, see this study that was published in Food and Chemical Toxicology. The conclusion was: \"71 healthy subjects were treated with placebos and monosodium L-glutamate (MSG) doses of 1.5, 3.0 and 3.15 g/person, which represented a body mass-adjusted dose range of 0.015\u20130.07 g/kg body weight before a standardized breakfast over 5 days. The study used a rigorous randomized double-blind crossover design that controlled for subjects who had MSG after-tastes. Capsules and specially formulated drinks were used as vehicles for placebo and MSG treatments. Subjects mostly had no responses to placebo (86%) and MSG (85%) treatments. Sensations, previously attributed to MSG, did not occur at a significantly higher rate than did those elicited by placebo treatment. A significant (P < 0.05) negative correlation between MSG dose and after-effects was found. The profound effect of food in negating the effects of large MSG doses was demonstrated. The common practice of extrapolating food-free experimental results to \u2018in use\u2019 situations was called into question. An exhaustive review of previous methodologies identified the strong taste of MSG as the factor invalidating most \u2018blind\u2019 and \u2018double-blind\u2019 claims by previous researchers. The present study led to the conclusion that \u2018Chinese Restaurant Syndrome\u2019 is an anecdote applied to a variety of postprandial illnesses; rigorous and realistic scientific evidence linking the syndrome to MSG could not be found.\" Here's the link if you'd like to read more. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/027869159390012N . If you can cite a peer reviewed paper that has all 3 of those controls and shows an effect, I'd love to read it.",

MSG (truly terrible for your health and, despite what some studies show, many people are allergic to it, including my mother who gets violently ill and has to be hospitatlized), sodium caseinate (has links to high incidences of cancer in more than one study, and of autism in children) and 10 grams of salt, not to mention the Activa RM . Honestly, this one is barely 'food', but considering what so many Americans eat that most other countries wouldn't touch if their lives depended on it I'm probably not that surprised. \n\nUsually love your recipes, but wouldn't touch this one with a 10 foot :)",

(Biased personal experiences are not conclusive evidence.)\n\nPS, I have autism. So keeping up on this sort of information is kind of important to me. Please don't go throwing us around as a reason to stay away from various things without bedrock evidence. Autism has a huge genetic component anyway--twin and family studies indicate that.\n\nAs far as people being allergic to MSG--some people are deathly allergic to peanuts, should none of us then cook with peanuts or write recipes that have peanuts in them? the whole initial MSG scare was based on bad science. For most people, it's fine--for people who have sensitivities, obviously they should avoid this recipe and choose another one.",

It means that, to retire, I need only rekindle the market for dowsing rods, reike, or some variant of \"Airborne\".\n\nSecond, I've been wondering how the world can't seem to produce a \"textural\" veggie burger. They tend, inevitably, to crumble to pieces or taste like some kind of packing material. (This is most often the case when it is thrown on a menu as a \"token\" vegetarian option.)\n\nI didn't realize that transglutaminase would work on other proteins. Can you actually bind vegetable proteins at all or? As for those who fear it, I suspect they'd also be frightened off by sodium chloride or dihydrogen monoxide. (Too much of either is guaranteed fatal. Even a tiny amount of the former in your lungs can cause violent coughing.)\n\nThe one caveat is that, in at least my first search for a source, it came up at ~$90 for two pounds. Fortunately, there are some other sources for MUCH less.\n\ndB",

      "content": "I am super confused as to why people are referring to Transglutaminase as MSG. MSG is monosodium glutamate. I buy regularly from Modernist Pantry, and Transglutaminase is one of the items I noticed that they sell. MSG is not listed as an ingredient in any of their Transglutaminase packages (although I suppose it could be naturally occurring in one or more of the ingredients). This is commonly known as \"Meat Glue\" and the public became more aware of it during the Pink Slime incident a few years ago. I am vegan and would not buy it because one of the common ingredients is dairy derived and the packages do not specify whether or not the enzymes used in the Transglutaminase are animal or plant derived. I was really excited to try this recipe, but I would need to find a source of confirmed plant based Transglutaminase to do that.",
