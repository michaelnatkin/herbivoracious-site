I tried to look for some but could only find cracked bulghur, which looked messy (I wanted whole grains, they look better in pictures). I ended up buying couscous, which is a real disappointment.",

      "content": "Hmmm...Bacon Salt, huh?  My husband was just saying the other day that he wished there was a vegetarian version of bacon.  Not too thrilled about the artificial flavoring aspect, but maybe a little bit isn't too bad.  We use all these other substitutions (capers for anchovies, tofu/mushrooms/cheese for meat), so maybe I'll have to give Bacon Salt a chance.  Just gotta see how bad the ingredients are first.",
