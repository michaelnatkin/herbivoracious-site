      "content": "Nice one.  BTW, \"bhel\" is a type of snack made from puffed rice.  Puffed rice is called \"mamra\" or \"kurmura.\"\n\nAlmost-ripe diced mangoes or pomegranate seeds also work well in this kind of chaat.\n\nAnother option to getting the crunch if you don't have rice crackers is to fry or bake 1-inch tortilla squares.",

      "content": "So Micheal, I surprised (possibly shocked) my Indian-food-obsessed hubby by making this as part of an Indian meal last night.  Made the lot, including the masala and the chutney.  Wow. It was lip-smackingly good. We first ate Chana Chaat at a fabulous Indian restaurant in Manchester years ago. We've fantasized about theirs since and yours might just be joining the legend. The chutney ended up smeared on pretty much everything we ate. Yum, yum, yum. Cheers for the recipe. Emer",
