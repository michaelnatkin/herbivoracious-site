      "content": "Yes, that makes sense. My understanding is that in general a lot of cheesemakers use microbial rennets these days, because they are less expensive and more widely available. But I imagine that to be parmigiano-reggiano DOP they would have to use the traditional animal rennet. Because in general it has been so hard to know what cheese is really made with what rennet, I've personally chosen to ignore that issue and just eat all cheeses. But those who aren't comfortable with that may wish to investigate specific cheeses (or go vegan). The web has probably made that much easier. Thanks for the note!",
