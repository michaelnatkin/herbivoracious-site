      "content": "I finally got over my fear of making gnocchi, but now I need to conquer the sauteeing and browning step. Mine just stuck to the pan. I assume I didn't use enough oil to coat them after they were boiled.? Your version sounds great with raddicchio and ricotta salata.",

      "content": "Interesting; yeah you shouldn&#39;t have sticking when you pan fry them. I agree, either you needed more oil in the post-boil toss, or in the pan when frying. Also, you want to use a skillet that isn&#39;t inclined to stick too much - either a non-stick pan or a cast iron skillet.",
