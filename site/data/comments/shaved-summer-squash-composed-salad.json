      "content": "Hey...I think I recognize that carrot. It looks like a \"Purple Haze.\" You can get some really nifty effects by peeling the outside of those first...and then just keep on peeling. As you do so, you get thin strips that have lovely purple coloring along the edges. Can make for a very attention-getting garnish.\n\n(Congrats on the challenge; in honor of it, we made the recipe again last night. Still good. :) )",
