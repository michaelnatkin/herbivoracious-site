      "content": "Hi, thanks for the good filling ideas :D Your recipes and photos are definitely among the vegetarian high class.\n\nBut I do have 2 remarks: first of all, Chinese Jiaozi are NOT potstickers, they are always boiled in a big pot like pierogi. I come from Poland so I know my way around with the latter, and I made Jiaozi already together with Chinese friends, so I know that too.\n\nSecond, which results from the first, I know how to make those \"wrappers\" and all you need is (preferably high protein) flour, water and lots of kneading and rolling out :) Some gyoza skins may contain eggs, but this is not generally common, the trick is the high protein flour, the eggs are sometimes used if the flour does not have high quality. The \"wrappers\" are only sold as a time saving short cut, it may be even healthier to prepare them at home, since some Asian convenience products tend to contain not so healthy additives, which are not always listed :/\n\nIt is not difficult to prepare those wrappers, if you ever made Polish pierogi (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi),\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi),</a> you can make homemade Jiaozi wrappers too, those are just thinner and more springy (the high protein trick). I admit I use the Jiaozi dough method at home when I make pierogi since I saw the great results, and it is also good when eggs are a problem for health reasons or for vegans.",

Re the name, see the wikipedia page for Jiaozi under the Chinese section - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyoza\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyoza</a> - jiaozi is generic for dumpling, there are subvariants for steamed (<i>shuijiao),</i> pan fried (<i>guotie)</i>, and boiled (<i>zhengjiao)</i>.",

Also, you should be looking for a even taste with the filling, not chunks of ingredients, so a food processor is more fitting here for the cabbage and scallions.\n\nMethodology for the actual cooking is very spot on.",
