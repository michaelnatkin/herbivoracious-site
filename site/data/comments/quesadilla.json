      "content": "This reminds me of something that I discovered recently about corn vs flour tortillas: Store bought flour tortillas tend to be loaded with salt, while store bought corn tortillas generally have little to no salt in them, yet corn tortillas still taste plenty good. I realized this while coming up with things to eat for a relative who is salt sensitive, and was shocked to see how much salt it is possible to consume unwittingly in just the flour tortillas in a quesadilla.",

Wow, who knew?\n\nThanks for the tip about getting them crispy, we've been doing (vegan) pesto quesadillas with marinara. Sort-of a Mex-Italian \"fusion\" thing, right? SOOOOOO good!!\n\nAlways love your posts as usual!",

      "content": "Ah, yis...the secret, revealed.\n\nWe make a lot of corn quesadillas here, probably too many.\n\nI tend to use walnut oil (or butter, depending on the filling) as my brushing oil because here in Yurp it's about the same price as olive oil, and the flavor is so much more complementary to Mexican and Southwestern food.\n\nI also dust my quesadillas with a little smoked paprika and cinnamon while they're in the pan. Smells great and adds a bit of mystery, long as you don't use too much.",
