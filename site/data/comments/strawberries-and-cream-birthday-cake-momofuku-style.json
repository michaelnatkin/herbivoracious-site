      "content": "I like your frosting idea, buffing up whipped cream with cream cheese. As far as cutting out cake, Wilton makes a six inch cake round, which seems to be rage now (to make what is called tiny cakes) enough for four or six. I like that idea a lot. You can then slice each in half and have a tiny four-layer cake. I still want to check out that cookbook though.",
