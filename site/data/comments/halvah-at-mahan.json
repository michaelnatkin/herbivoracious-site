      "content": "Can't resist sharing a couple more recs, if you're going back to the shuk:  first, go to Pe'er, the best bakery in town.  their challah is absolutely to die for.  Living in Israel, I stopped making my own challah altogether because they were so nearby.  And all Americans love rugelach from \"Marzipan\", a bakery on Agrippas. as you exit the shuk to the left, it's on your left.  Their chocolate rugelach are meltaway delicious.  enjoy!",
