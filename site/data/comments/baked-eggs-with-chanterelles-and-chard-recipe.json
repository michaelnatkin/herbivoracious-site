      "content": "Hey Michael - As a fellow buttermilk fan, making your own creme fraiche is dead simple.  Just a tablespoon or two per cup of heavy cream, a clean jar and a day.  See here: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=make+your+own+creme+fraiche&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=make+your+own+creme+fraiche&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8</a>\n\nTrust me.  Once you do it, you won't buy it in the store again. (And you'll be adding it to everything!)",
