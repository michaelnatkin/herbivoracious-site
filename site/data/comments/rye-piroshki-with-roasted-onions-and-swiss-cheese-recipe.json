      "content": ":) Lovely piroshki!  I know that bakery on Pike Place Market, it's a good one. There is another place in Auburn, that makes fantastic piroshki, both baked and deep fried. They also have a great selection of other baked goods and variety of vegetarian meals. Love that place! \nTraditionally, piroshki were made of rye flour, and only recently wheat flour started to dominate.  So you made an authentic piroshki! :) All is missing is a drink, that piroshki were served with: kvas, which is fermented drink made off stale rye bread, water and a little sugar. You can see a photo of kvas (http://www.picnicatmarina.com/2012/06/cold-summer-soup-okroshka.html). :)",

      "content": "Oh my god, the kvas looks fantastic! Interesting that piroshki were traditionally made with rye - I had done some basic searching and hadn't come up with that, though I'm not surprised given where they are from. If you know where to find a traditional recipe, please share.",

      "content": "Hi Michael! \n\nI am teaching a hands-on piroshky class at PCC Cooks this fall and would love to share my recipes with you! We'll be making savory piroshky with cabbage and carrots and sweet ones with apples, as well as larger, sharing-size pies with mushrooms and onions. I use wheat flour, so my recipe is not \"traditional\" in that sense, but it does come from my mother-in-law who lives in Siberia! \n\nHere is a link to the class schedule: http://www.pccnaturalmarkets.com/pcccooks/classes/detail.php?id=1691. I hope you can join us! \n\nIrina",

I have a few books on history of Russian food downloaded to my computer, and wasn't able to un-zip it. Let me deal with it, and then I'll send you the information. Are you like me interested in food anthropology?! :)",
