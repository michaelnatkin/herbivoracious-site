      "content": "That meal definitely tastes great, with all garlic-lemon-parsley-tarragon flavor! I wouldn't even use ricotta, just the gremolata and garlic. Beautiful presentation on a lovely Italian (?) plate. Have you made orecchiette? I'd like to try to make it from scratch (well, no other options available for me here), but haven't find a recipe yet. I watch a video how to form it, but no recipe of flour/water proportion. I heard it's different from a regular pasta, is it? Have a great week, Michael!",
