Looks like I'll have to give your recipe a try...\n\nAlso, I love your new blog style/layout. Although I have to confess that I haven't visited for a short while (I'm a bit behind), so I'm not sure how \"new\" it really is.  Either way, it looks GREAT :)",

Chili is one of those dishes where I often prefer vegetarian versions to meaty ones - there's so much flavor already, the meat just seems sort of unnecessary.  I had a delicious veggie chili a few weeks ago that included chick peas along with pinto and black beans that I've been wanting to try to recreate, thanks for sharing your method so I have a great starting point!",

I needed a GF, veggie meal for some new friends this weekend, & after many days trolling the net found your great site.\nNow you say this is easy - in Seattle, fantastic city that it is, I'm sure it would be, but here in rural Tasmania, Australia, not so easy! First finding dried beans was a task! I had assorted beans, which I tested, used & seemed fine, but the available purchase from the supermarket warned they could contain gluten! Oh NO!\nIn my nearest town I found a grocers with just 2 bags of red kidneys left, but no black or pinto, so had to substitute Grt Northern &  Borlotti, which with their red striped shells added visual texture as well as flavour.\nDuring my research, I was reminded that un-soaked dried beans carry certain toxins & ingestion is not recommended, and it was advised that to reduce flatulence multiple rinsing & over-night soaking was recommended. I also remember my Gran using bicarb of soda in her 1st soaking (boiling) water (which I believe aids color retention while reducing the gaseous effects! I think my beans were really fresh, as I only soaked them 6-hrs, rinsing & replacing the soaking water twice, and I suspect the beans were cooked in around 30 minutes, so the 1-hr+ was much too much for my beans!\nNow to the Pepper! I loved this idea of smoked pepper flavor, but I was unable to locally source Chiptole - can you advise a suitable substitute? There were NO smoked chili's in my supermarkets or grocers, so I cooked up extra as per recipe, and highly recommend this method for adding a wonderful depth & warmth to any dish requiring a bit of heat, with none of that nasty bitterness which I find with reg store-bought ground chili. I cooked up extra, removed the seeds & ground the pods to pepper for extra garnish & to now add heat to other dishes. I found reg bottled whole chilies & jalape\u00f1o peppers, which I de-seeded & used instead of your (unavailable!) suggestions, together w/a few dashes of Tabasco, which I think worked really well, and let the dish mature for a good 24hrs.\nI then split the dish, adding my GF mince base to the half for those that liked it & leaving the veggie as was, although as the beans were over-done added some corn & chopped sweet peppers for fresh texture & color, put them all in the oven till ready to feast, then served with all the fixings, incldg: rice, grated carrot, assorted gf & wheat tortillas, guacamole, sour cream, shredded lettuce, parsley-chopped tomatoes AND fried polenta coyotes & cactus shapes for the kids to dip & sup - Hum Hummmmmmmm looked fab & was delicious - completed with my GF Bakewell Cake & Ice cream! What a Feast! So many thanks for this great site and a wonderful recipe that could make me the Chili Queen of Tasmania! :)",

I once got a huge can of chilli powder from sams that has a chilli blend and varoius spices like cumin etc. SO Far I have mostly used that for the chilli. But using a chilli combination sounds really fresh and much more flavourful..\n\nThis almost makes me wish cold weather was here soon.\n\nThanks",

      "content": "I made this vegetarian chili for a birthday party yesterday.  I am not a vegetarian, and I usually don't like vegetarian dishes (sorry!).  But, I was doing it for a very important friend and wanted the vegi chili to be DELICIOUS.  And, I was looking for a recipe where you build the flavors from scratch.\n\nMy friends, this is a good recipe.  It is incredibly flavorful.\n\nI was so impressed with the simplicity of this recipe as well.  Aside from soaking the beans, this recipe takes hardly any time.  I was able to find all the ingredients at my local grocery store, too.\n\nToasting the chilies in a pan gave such a beautiful deep flavor to the sauce, and the texture of the beans and other vegetables was very pleasing.  I agree that using soaked beans instead of canned is the way to go.  I may never use canned beans again, unless I have to - the texture is so much better.\n\nThank you so much for sharing this recipe.  You have introduced a new winter staple into our house, and several others.  You know everyone asked for the recipe because is was soooooooo delish!!",

      "content": "I've been looking for a really good vegetarian chili for some time. Nothing so far has met the mark. I want to try your recipe, but am scared it will blow our heads of with the heat. I guess we would like it extremely mild by your standards. Our normal supermarkets only have dried chili flakes (hot). They don't specify the type of chili. Is this okay to use? Or should I tried to hunt down some of the specific types you mentioned to get the right flavour? I'm fairly certain we can't get canned chipotle either.\n\nAlso, does type of bean matter? I have red kidney, but not pinto or black. I don't think we can even buy black beans (dried or can) around here (Australia). I have Adjuki, Navy/Haricot, Blackeye and Soy. Would using red kidney and substituing any of the other 2 I do have be okay?\n\nIf I end up with a chili that is perfect, I will make the effort to locate the right ingredients.",

Don&#39;t try to do this with dried chili flakes, they are typically quite hot by volume. Given your choices of substitution I&#39;d probably use only the kidney and blackeyed peas. I&#39;ve heard from others that the ingredient selection in Australia can be a lot smaller / different than what I&#39;m used to in the states. Good luck and let us know how it turns out!\n\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

Slow cooking the fresh beans allows the beans to absorb all of the sauce a lot better, and it just gives the chili so much more body to it.

However, I am now wondering if I can add anything to the mixture as it  cooks to tone down the spiciness a bit. Any suggestions?\n\nI only added half the chipotle peppers in sauce and toasted and put in 3 guajillo peppers....\n\nThank you so much in advance. I love your blog. Say HI to Sarina and girls ;-)\n\nBest,\nChihana",

      "content": "Hi Chihana - there really isn't anything you can do to remove spiciness once a dish is spicy. The heat comes from the capsaicin in the chile peppers and there is no way to filter it out. You can maybe add a small bit of sugar to reduce the perception of spiciness. Or you can try to dilute it somewhat, but that will affect the other flavors. Or you can serve it with a dairy product like sour cream which is good at removing some burn.",
