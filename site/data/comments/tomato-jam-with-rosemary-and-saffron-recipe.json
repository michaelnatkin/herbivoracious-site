      "content": "Hey Julie - I don&#39;t think that would hurt anything, but I&#39;m not completely sure it is necessary in this case. The long slow cooking on the stove top seems to develop a lot of caramelized flavor, especially if you are careful to let it cook until it is quite thick at the end. In general I&#39;m a big fan of oven roasted tomatoes though. Here&#39;s a nice dish to try if you do roast some tomatoes: <a href=\"https://herbivoracious.com//2009/08/roasted-tomato-and-corn-risotto-recipe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://herbivoracious.com//2009/08/roasted-tomato-and-corn-risotto-recipe.html</a> .",

      "content": "Interesting idea! My hubbs made some once, but as something sweet to have on toast - yuk! [sorry!]  But I like your notion as kind of a chutney. What would you think of honey instead of sugar? I can't do sugar or dairy so always substitute. Nowadays it's hard to get agave that hasn't been processed till it's over the hill, so raw honey might be the best??? [Would it have to be thickened a bit with arrowroot?] Love your recipes - keep 'em coming!",

Honey could be good but I&#39;d use the lightest, mildest one I could find for this recipe, because you don&#39;t want the honey flavor to overwhelm the other components.",

      "content": "I agree with Michael that the honey would overwhelm the delicate flavor of the tomato. How about a bit of stevia instead? Available at most health food markets. And, Michael, this fabulous-sounding recipe would absolutely work to \"put up\" in jars. I have 14 heirloom tomato plants, so I will very soon be overwhelmed with fruit... I might just have to put up a few jars of this yumminess and save it for Christmas presents! It would be beautiful in fancy little jars!",

Tons of great books out there with excellent tips and recipes, and cute little jars are available at grocery stores as well as upscale boutique kinds of stores. I could go on for a long time about how great canning is, but I will exercise a little restraint here! :) I will be anxious to hear about your experience when you finally do start canning.",

      "content": "Many years ago (say, 40-45) my mother made (and canned - I think she got the proportions from the Agricultural Extension) a tomato jam that we ate on breakfast toast - I remember it as wonderful, but that could be because there was never very much of it, so it was a treat.  I may need to try this  . . . altho without the chili and pepper; my husband's allergic to them.  Maybe a few cumin seeds instead.",

      "content": "Michael, I think the recipe looks cannable the way it is since you have the 2 T lemon juice to bring up the acidity of the tomatoes. Acidity is a concern when using the \"hot bath\" canning method, but not if using a pressure canner. I checked several of my canning books, and all add at least 2 T lemon juice to about 1 quart of tomatoes. Most of the recipes for tomato jam (or marmalade or butter) called for tons of sugar - some as much as equal parts tomato and sugar! In my experience, sugar is often a matter of taste - some like more, some like less. But in canning, the crucial issue usually is acidity. It looks like you have more than enough to address that issue. That being said, I would highly recommend checking out a couple of resources just to be on the safe side. Ball has a nice, all-purpose guide to start with. Canning is great fun and very rewarding, but not without some risks if you are not careful. (that's my \"fine print disclaimer\" part) I can tell you that I will definitely be trying this recipe out, and I will definitely can some using the hot bath method. I will let you know how it turns out.",

The experts usually say don't guess, and only use canning recipes from reputable sources, such as your local extension service or the Ball Blue Book.

      "content": "Hi Michael, here's a little update on the canning of this tomato jam recipe... I used tomatoes from my garden (all heirlooms, some yellow, mostly red) and doubled the quantity - if you're gonna put food up, you might as well make it worth the effort! I tripled the lemon juice, though, since many of my tomatoes are on the sweet side and seem a bit low on acid. I didn't quite double everything else, though, so as not to over sweeten or overwhelm the tomatoes. It turned out delicious! And... I now have half a dozen jars. I am going to let them sit in the pantry for a while to see what happens. My hunch is that everything will be just fine. There is plenty of acid in there to take care of the onion issue that Lisa was concerned about. As I was tasting it, I couldn't help thinking how delicious it would be with some fresh goat cheese. That is on my list to make this week... I'll let you know.  And I'll keep you posted on the jars.",
