      "content": "I disagree. It is Syrian style because of the choice of spices. Aleppo pepper is quite clearly Syrian, and it is the flavor choices of a woman deeply rooted in the cuisine of the Aleppan Jews. So yes, Labneh is all over the Middle East, but this version of it is specifically Syrian, more specifically Aleppan.",

      "content": "Mmm!  I like labneh with za'atar as the spice mix.  (Za'atar, as well as labneh, baklava and other dishes show up all over the Middle East, including Syria, so when a Syrian cookbook comes out, it's only natural that it should include these pan-Middle-Eastern dishes as well as uniquely Syrian ones.  I don't think it insults anyone to show how widespread a certain dish is throughout a region--rather, I think it's fascinating to look at the very subtle variations that occur when you follow that dish across borders).",

      "content": "Wonderful to see you writing about yogurt cheese. We like it so much we wrote a cookbook and guide to expand its uses. We even paid to have yogurt cheese analyzed in a lab for nutritional content. Yogurt cheese (or YoChee as we call it) is a wonderful versatile ingredient you can make at home to improve your own yogurt. It has substantial health and taste benefits (a creamy food which is low or no fat plus high protein and calcium). I hope you will take a look at,\u201d Eat Well the YoChee Way\u201d our guide and cookbook to this important food. It really increases the use of yogurt cheese to main courses, soups, sauces, desserts, and much more. (Nutritional content included). Our website YoChee.com contains a free yogurt cheese how - to slide show, nutrition information and free recipes.",

I'll have to find the aleppo pepper next time i'm the middle eastern store.\n\nI'm so conditioned to eating a sweet version of this growing up.  In India, they call it shrikhand and it's flavored with saffron & pistachios & sometimes fruit.",

      "content": "Just wondering if it would be okay to add fresh chives, basil, etc. to the yogurt itself, and then let the whey drain off.  Seems likeit would be a good way to get teh flavors of the herbs to release more into the cheese.  What do you think??",

      "content": "I've never tried it that way, but I don't think there would be anything fundamentally wrong with it. My guess is that the herb flavor would be more evenly distributed (which could be good or bad depending on your preference), and more intense, but possibly less fresh. The volatile oils in fresh herbs release their top notes pretty quickly. If you try it both ways, please let us know which you like!",
