I wonder how it would be if I mixed and matched with my recipe of red lentil soup. Maybe I'll skip the mint and use bulgur and see how the outcome is. I'll let you know. Thank you for a great recipe Michael:)",

I love lentil soup and used to make it with tomatoes, carrots and onions, nasturtium leaves, etc., to give it flavor. My daughter tasted one of my richest creations and said, \"Where's the flavor?\" Then I tried this soup. The lentils smelled good as they boiled, but when I added the spices, I suddenly had the intense flavor and hearty aroma I love. And my daughter was amazed that her old Dad could make something so delicious--and with so very few ingredients.",

      "content": "Well, I'll try answering that, as a Jew living in Israel where we get bombed frequently by our not-so-nice Arab residents and neighbors. We've always been a distinct people, with dietary laws from the Torah that have been kept alive until today. For that reason, our food, no matter where we've lived over the past 2K years, has reflected the tastes of the local population, but with twists and blends not found in non-Jewish cooking. For example, a soup like this might make use of meat or chicken (by both Jews and non-Jews) but we could not use butter as the oil, or top with a dairy product as non-Jews would very likely do.\n\nBut more than that, this recipe and others by the author, are relics of a place and time: Jewish living in Syria \"back in the olden days.\" Today, the Jews have been effectively made refugees from most Muslim countries since the establishment of Israel. There simply aren't many left in Syria and other middle eastern countries. Just a few months ago the remaining Jewish community in Yemen was sent to Israel under threat of death by the surrounding community after living there continuously for more than 2K years. So, there food and tradtions have not yet undergone such modernizing as many other immigrant Jewish communities in say the US, Israel, etc. So, yes, what difference does it make if it's a JEwish recipe or a Christian (or I'll add Muslim)? It sure makes a difference to us Jews, and it's historically made, and currently make a difference to non-Jews. Thanks for your inquiry. I hope I did it justice.",

But when I tasted it, having left it sit for about 15-20 minutes, the flavor was amazing! So subtle and yet so flavorful. I sprinkled it with cumin, chopped corriander and a squeeze of lemon and it was wonderful. I also added about 1/2 tsp more of kosher salt to the whole pot. What a great, easy soup. And the aroma of the garlic and corriander seeds as I pounded them with the mortar and pestle was so fragrant! (BTW I only used 1 TBS of olive oil to fry the paste).",

Cook the same way as with rice, just add the wheat instead. When it\u2019s done fry up your pile of onions and pour on top. We also have mint, yogurt and fl\u00e9fl\u00e9 for accompanying. \nHope this is what you were thinking about! \nMa salame",
