      "content": "This sounds fantastic. I was surprised that you used high heat to fry the eggplant - does that really cook it through without burning? I can't seem to fry eggplant, no matter how low the heat, without setting off the smoke alarm. I use olive oil (not extra virgin, just regular) - do you think veg. oil would do the trick?\n\nI haven't tried panko on eggplant, but I will definitely try that next. I like to mix in some herbs with my breadcrumbs, especially herbes de Provence with a little extra dried lavender. Something about the sweet lavender makes the eggplant seem even sweeter.",

      "content": "Hi Anne - yes, I think if you switch to an oil that has a higher smoke point you'll get better results. Spectrum Organics makes a canola oil that is specifically for high heat that I find works very well. For this recipe on my stove, I want to be just about 1 notch under maximum heat, but of course it may vary based on your burners and pan. Herbs de Provence in your breadcrumbs sounds delicious!",

      "content": "Hi Michael, I have made a few of your recipes before and they've been delicious but I wasn't so happy with the results of this one made worse by the fact that I made this for dinner guests. It came out too dry and we couldn't really taste the eggplant. Maybe too heavy on the breadcrumbs? I'm not exactly sure where I went wrong but if I was going to make it again I would slice the eggplant thicker and use either more sauce or not reduce the sauce as suggested. Thanks for posting this but I think I'll stick with the Vietnamese Lemongrass Green Beans and Tofu...yum!",

Paired it with a little salad with veggies from the market, edible flowers from my garden, and a homemade orange-mint dressing with mint from the garden. (and a gin and mint drink of course). Perfect perfect meal.\n\nDays like these make me fall in love with food over and over and over again!",

      "content": "Quite right. True parmigiano-reggiano is always made with animal rennet. I, like many vegetarians, choose not to let this particular detail go. I pretty much will eat any kind of cheese. If you want animal-rennet free cheese, in general you'll have to do a fair amount of research. Microbial and vegetable rennets are often cheaper than animal rennet, so even cheeses that aren't specifically labeled are often safe in practice. Hopefully your cheesemonger will know.",

He planted a garden this year and I convinced him to plant some for me. I picked my first one today along with a huge zucchini, so I plan to make this recipe with one end being eggplant and the other zucchini....wonder how it will go over. I have fresh mozarell, basil and tomatoes to top it off.  I think he will love it.  Well, better get to work!",

      "content": "So I made this dish one night after work (with chicken in addition to the eggplant for the non-veggie lovers in my house), and I made the unfortunate mistake of misreading your instructions to give the eggplant a \"heavy *sprinkling*\" and gave it a heavy rub, instead.  Even though I wiped off as much salt as I could, it was far too salty to eat.  Luckily, the chicken parmesan was divine, and I was sad that I ruined the eggplant.\n\nSo now for my question so I don't mess it up next time:  what constitutes a heavy sprinkling?  When do you cross the line into a heavy rub?  Should I be tasting the raw eggplant to make sure I haven't over salted?",
