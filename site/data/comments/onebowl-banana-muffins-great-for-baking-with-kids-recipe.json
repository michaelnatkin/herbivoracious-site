I was a little nervous because my butter was a bit clumpy, but when these came out of the oven they were the prettiest muffins I have ever made.  Not only were they gorgeous, but the tasted divine.  They were delicate & moist; sweet, but not too sweet.  We can't stop eating them...yum yum! Thanks so much for a perfect Sunday morning treat.",

And yes, you are so right, the key to tender muffins (and pancakes) is to stop mixing when it is still kinda clumpy. I know it seems scary, like there is going to be terrible bits of dry flour in the finished product, but that isn&#39;t what happens.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

      "content": "When I read this recipe I couldn't help but try it immediately. I started the Eating Alive Program yesterday and had to make a few substitutions (instead of egg = I extra banana, 1C brown sugar = 1/4C algave nectar, whole wheat flour), and the muffins came out perfectly. The banans add just the right amount of sweetness and they came out of the oven looking fabulous and scrumptious. Thank you very much for posting. I really enjoyed stumbling across your informative and inspiring website this evening! I also made the Thai mango salad for dinner :)",
