      "content": "Michael,\nI love the look and feel and introduction and author of this book, and I want to love the recipes as well but I have not had success with the few recipes I have tried.  I love prune and armagnac ice cream and his was completely inedible.  I had to throw the whole thing away.  He calls for putting sour cream in a food processor with prunes and other such tricks, but it never completely froze (he calls for too much booze) and it was like half frozen sour cream or something.  Horrible.  I also had some students prepare the aztec chocolate and the cinnamon and both lacked the flavors I expected (could have been student error).  Oh well.  Maybe I should give it another crack.\n\nI have gone back to the classic anglaise base for all ice creams, infusing flavor or garnish as needed, and find that short of a restaurant-grade machine it as close as I can come to texture,consistency and flavor of pro ice cream at home.\n\nI do like his tips about using a little booze to soften homemade ice creams, and I also follow his tip about dutch processed cocoa, though can't say as I personally notice a difference.\n\nDo you follow his recipes word for word?",

      "content": "Hi Michael: Glad you liked the recipe! It reminds me that I need to make it again.\n\nTo the previous commenter that had trouble with the Prune-Armagnac Ice Cream, that ice cream is somewhat softer, but since its not custard-based, I found that it could handle more liqueur than other ice creams. I wonder if it had to do with the prunes; some may absorb more liqueur than others, depending on their dryness.\n\n(Pille at <a href=\"http://nami-nami.blogspot.com/2008/04/this-guy-knows-his-ice-cream-david.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nami-Nami</a> made it, and hers is on the softer side, but she liked it quite a bit.)",

      "content": "Hey Paul - I've had good luck with all of the recipes I've tried in the book; I can't say I follow any recipe word-for-word but I came pretty close on the pear-caramel. I know David tests his recipes obsessively, so I'm guessing the prune-armagnac came from some ingredient difference in the prunes or sour cream or something. I do always taste an ice cream base before freezing, because it has to have *intense* flavor to still taste good when cold.",

That ice cream puts our own <a href=\"http://www.mollymoonicecream.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Molly Moon's</a> salted caramel ice cream to shame, I must say.\n\nI think you've bumped up the pear-caramel to next on my list now.",

      "content": "Just found this recipe yesterday as I was searching for what to do with three pears I had that weren't getting better in the kitchen. I only had .5C of cream leftover from another meal so I added 1.5C 2% milk. I also stirred in some vanilla, ground ginger and ground clove as pear/cream mixture cooled. I like  \"bits of stuff\" in my ice cream so I just use my immersion blender so smooth out some of it, leaving chunks of sweet pear in the mixture. My husband ate nearly the entire batch in one night! We had to force ourselves to put it back in the freezer - it is that delicious. It reminds me of a pear trifle I made at Christmas time - elegant but comforting. I will definitely be making it again and again and again. Thank you for sharing!",
