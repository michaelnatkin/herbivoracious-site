      "content": "The egg whites allow the seasonings to adhere to the pecans while also baking up into a crisp coating. I'm not readily aware of other ingredients that can achieve the same effect. I've made spiced nuts with butter before - it doesn't create that same crunchy coating, but it may be an alternative.",
