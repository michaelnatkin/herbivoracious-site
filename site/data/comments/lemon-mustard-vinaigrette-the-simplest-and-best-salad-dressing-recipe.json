      "content": "This recipe looks fantastic.  I've been using simple lemon juice and canola oil to dress my salads since I've gotten away from vinegar because it's a food of decay.  As much as I love the lemon juice and oil, it's getting just a little boring.  And as a mustard lover, I think that might be just the thing to spice it up!",
