      "content": "I grew up in Israel and Amba may be my favorite condiment (well, a close second to horseradish). It's great on sandwiches (instead of mustard) and I also eat it with a simple Moroccan recipe that I make--  meatballs, sweet peas (canned), onions and powder Israeli chicken broth (by Osem). \n\nI tend to find it in specialty Israeli / Middle Eastern stores... there is usually a few in every major city. \n\nI am excited to try this recipe.",
