      "content": "Hi Sue - thanks for the comment! We didn't go to any of the veggie places, because Italian food is so veg friendly anyhow. You are just basically always ordering a Primi (first course). Anywhere you go there are going to be several veg pastas and often pizzas and salads, and also check out the contorni (roasted vegetables on display). I've got to write more reviews up but our favs were Piperno and Taverna Degli Amici, and we detested Obika. For some awesome baked goods check I really liked Forno Marco Rosciolo.\n\nHave a great trip!\n\nMichael",
