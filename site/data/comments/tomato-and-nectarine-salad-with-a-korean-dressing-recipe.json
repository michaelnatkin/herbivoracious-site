      "content": "Tomatoes are so glorious right now! I gave up on growing them in my own garden when June in Seattle was so atrocious. But I've been visiting a couple of farmstands in Snohomish to get my fill. I've yet to try heirloom tomatoes with stone fruit, but this looks fabulous. Must give it a try.",

      "content": "Thank you, Michael. Forgot to ask you: what camera do you use? In your book you mentioned that you \"graduated from point-and-shoot to DSLR\", but no specifics.  \nYes, I've read your book, and cooked from it too. :) I need to tell you I was impressed by the Introduction so much that I read it twice. Your writing style is elegant to details, sophisticated and yet pleasant. Your books moves me away from my comfort zone to a whole new world of adventure and excitement in my kitchen. And I am grateful for that! :)",
