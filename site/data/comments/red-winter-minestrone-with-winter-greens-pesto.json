      "content": "Beet-greens: yes! I'm not sure about *mature* beet-greens, but the young ones --- the ones culled by the farmer when s/he plants a whole row and then has to thin the herd --- can be really wonderful. (It helps to know a beet-farmer, since these otherwise just get thrown out or fed to animals, etc.) When you get THAT kind, you get the whole plant, which leaf-to-root is probably only 6 inches. A quick blanch and a vinegar-y dressing makes a wonderful side-dish for a late-spring meal.  If there's some way to get a similar flavor sensation -- halfway between  beets, collard greens, and chard -- from the late-season thing, I'm all for it!",

      "content": "Just made this tonight for company.  The soup turned from red to green when  one tablespoon of pesto,which surprised us all, don't know why.  Maybe it was because we are used to beet red dominating.  The soup was delicious and wonderful on a cold snowy evening.\n\nAs I am allergic to dairy I skipped the cheese and added pine nuts and nutritutional yeast plus a dash of Harissa to the pesto.\n\nI am recommending your book to all my friends.",
