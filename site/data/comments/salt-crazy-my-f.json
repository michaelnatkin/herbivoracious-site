      "content": "At first I thought the whole salt obsession was a bit nuts.  Of course then I started picking up different salts as little treats for my salt loving husband.  I believe I contributed both the Hawaiian salts and the Balinese.\n\nAfter numerous late night salt tastings and pairing created by Michael, I have learned to appreciate some of the unique qualities of salt.  My fascination lies more in enjoying Michael's passion for salt than in the actual salts themselves.  He is willing to try almost any imaginable combinations, this is when I am thankful he is a vegetarian.",
