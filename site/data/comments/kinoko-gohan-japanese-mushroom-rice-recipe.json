      "content": "The dish looks so amazing! I remember having this dish in Osaka 2 years ago. It was really delicious. Mushrooms are an absolute delight to add into our meals. Somehow, I've grown up loving mushrooms (doesn't matter whether it is Asian mushrooms or European mushrooms - makes no difference to me as each has its own unique taste). Some dishes can only be prepared with a particular mushroom to get that unique taste. A chef  will certainly know the difference!\n\nBy the way, I have also posted another similar recipe using Shitake mushrooms. It is also deep fried and vegetarian. If anyone is interested, do read it at http://www.holisticlivingannex.com/2012/04/shitake-delight.html\n\nKeep it up! Waiting for more...",
