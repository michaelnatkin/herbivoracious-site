I'll act all surprised and everything, promise.\n\nNo, seriously, I have EVERYTHINg to make this without having to shop (tomatoes, corn and squash from the garden - though I may use yellow patty-pan instead since I have those coming out my ears).\n\nDEFINITELY will be making it soon. The tomato olive oil sounds divine!\n\nCan I still review the recipe if I don't do it exactly as written (i.e. no cheese)? Cause I'd LOVE to do that!!",
