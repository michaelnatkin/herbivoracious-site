      "content": "Could not find email or phone info on their site. I wanted to contact them directly. I got tired of having to soak whole muscle parts in teriyaki marinade sauce for days on end to get adequate penetration for flavor infusion. So I started using a technique known as pressure infusion marination to speed up the flavor infusion side of the marination equation. Google for \u201cpressure infusion marination\u201d now, if you like.\n\nI have no clue how to contact the chefs on the truck. If I could, I would ask them \u201cHey guyz \u2013 do any of your recipes utilize \u201cpressure infusion marination\u201d technique?\u201d Surely someone reading this post can give me a site I can post to that these guys read on some frequency basis \u2013 or an eMail address I can hook up with someone on the truck \u2013 a cell phone might be asking a bit much. But I\u2019ll take anything. Heck, U can mail me if you want \u2013 MrFizz [aat] Geee Mail [daught] com. Or heck, buzz me up at (409)FIZZ-GIZ. Many thx!\n\nCan anyone tell me if pressure infusion marination is one of their techniques?",
