I do agree a Vegan blog goes beyond the recipes....I call it the vegetarian way...I have been a vegetarian for 38 years and a complete Vegan for almost 20.  I am no longer on a soap box about it..I am just being me.  Many thanks...",

      "content": "Dawn - it is a very good question. Cheese can have rennet from animal, vegetable, or microbial sources, and it is very rarely clearly labeled. I&#39;ve heard anecdotally that the microbial source is cheapest and therefore quite common. Personally, this is the one thing in the lacto-ovo cannon I&#39;ve chosen to ignore. I know there are many people who go the same route, considering themselves to be vegetarian but eating cheese without finding out what kind of rennet is used, and others who include this in their list of concerns.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",
