      "content": "Yum. I just cooked two recipes from the cookbook this week. One was the tofu and onions in the sweet glaze, and the other was the polenta, mushroom, and kale casserole. My girlfriend, who doesn't normally like mushy things (polenta) or mushrooms or tofu, loved both dishes! I don't think it gets any better than that. This is one of the best cookbooks I have ever owned because the recipes are so easy yet incredibly delicious. It's been great to follow your blog for the past 2+ years and now have so much of it in a cookbook!!",

      "content": "Michael, that is a treat indeed! I haven't had fresh porcini mushrooms in two years (since we moved from Seattle actually). I didn't know they sell it there, we use to pick them in the forest... :) They are not easy to find, but when you come across one it's a gourmet dream come true. When we lived in Europe, porcini mushrooms were a usual part of our dinner. Isn't it interesting how moving from one place to another affects our dinner choices, making one's peasant food gourmet for another's! :) \nRoasting juices from this recipe I would use in soup (after drinking some!).",

      "content": ":) When we move back to Seattle (next year) I'll invite you for one of those foraging \"expeditions\". Although, we don't forage for mushrooms by ourselves, we have some expert friends. Usually it's a hike and a foraging trip with resting on the Hood Canal (those same friends have a waterfront property there). It's a fun activity for a whole family! \nThanks for changing commenting section, it is much easier and more user friendly, in my opinion. :) Happy Father's day, Michael!",
