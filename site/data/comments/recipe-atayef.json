      "content": "Hi Michael, these look fantastic. We only get atayef over in Egypt for Ramadan. We don't get the ricotta version because there is rarely ricotta over here. Your's look fantastic: yum, yum, yum! I've never tried to make them - it's too dangerous a road to start walking down for those who are sweet-toothed - but you're making me reconsider!",
