      "content": "Looks great...I myself am the lone raisin fan in my household, so I feel your pain.\n\nTwo immediately useful and somewhat tested variations/additions that spring to mind are 1) some kind of pairing with roasted cauliflower, pine nuts and saffron? May have to ditch the port for that one, and 2) in a chutney-er direction with tamarind and fennel seeds..again, not sure how the port would play with those two.",
