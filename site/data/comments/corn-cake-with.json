      "content": "I would like to try a modified version of this for a party. I am thinking about making thin rosemary-polenta crackers, topping with a thin layer of camembert, a pitted cherry, and then drizzling with a vinegar-cherry juice-honey reduction. Do you think that woudl work? I can't find sour cherry vinegar or white honey, but plan to use a nice balsamic and nice local floral honey. I may top with slivers of mint or lemon peel - or both?  I'd love to hear your suggestions - this is for a special party and the cherries are amazing right now!",

Since it is for a party, maybe you should make a test batch first to be sure you are happy with it. You could always use a store-bought cracker for the test, if you don&#39;t have time to bake an extra set of crackers.",
