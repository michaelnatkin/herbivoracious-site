      "content": "Thanks for the tip on Ideas in Food.  I hadn't come across it before and love to learn about molecular gastronomy so adding to my list.  I was especially excited to see it as I just made an inventory of random underutilized ingredients I want to use up this year, and they have a Shrimp Bolognese concept that uses Old Bay, one of the first items on my list.  I'll be interested to see your picks again in the future, looking forward to additional posts!",
