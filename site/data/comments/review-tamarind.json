      "content": "Lucky you! I love vietnamese food! But here in Brazil we don\u00b4t have any vietnamese restaurant... The first time I tried it I was 11 visiting Paris, it was the food I liked the most and never forgot. When I lived in NY I ate at a vietnamese restaurant at least 3 times a week...Now I miss that kind of food so much... thanks to you now I miss it even more! Great review!",
