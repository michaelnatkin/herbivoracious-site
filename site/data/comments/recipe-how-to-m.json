I think now it was the depth or narrowness of the various bowls I was using.  I'll use my big, flat roasting pan next time.  Thank you!",

Left it for 5 min then turned it over and fluffed it with out opening the bag. So much easier and left it in the bag till it was time to serve. MMMM thank you",

Beautiful buttery cous cous just like you get in a restaurant. Thank you so much for a great tip.",

So I got online, found this one which sounded easy, decided to make it, and only then (since I was on my phone) realized it was your website! (At first I just thought it was an ad popping up for your amazing cookbook, but then realized it was actually herbivoracious.com.)  It made a ton, but it turned out fluffy &amp; just perfect.  I'm not sure what the chances are that I would've found your recipe randomly (after only looking at a couple others), but I'm so glad I did! Thanks for contributing to my meal. (By the way, I also made Sarina's famous roasted cauliflower and it was a hit!)  Safe travels.",
