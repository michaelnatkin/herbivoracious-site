      "content": "I will have to try this - if I can get my hands on some buckwheat flour here in this hicktown I live in.  Have you ever tried whole wheat bread flour to make pancakes?  That's what I use, just because I have it on hand for bread (duh), and I don't have to use any white flour at all.  My favourite pancakes are 100% whole wheat - and even my white bread loving husband loves them.",

      "content": "Kismet, or the thinking alike of great minds? We just made buckwheat pancakes for dinner last night, but not with buttermilk, and we need a new recipe. Ours got the job done, but they were ultimately a little disappointing. My roommate hung one on the apartment door as a warning to other buckwheat pancake recipes: this is a tough crowd. We'll post our testing/tasting notes on this here recipe if (when) the craving hits again...but dang, real maple syrup has gotten expensive in Europe!",

      "content": "I taught both my children to cook and now my three year old granddaughter is joining me in the kitchen. Anything they can mix on their own in a bowl is great fun, but grab a stool or chair for your child to stand on to reach the counter, or set the bowls up on your child's little table. Hygiene is an important lesson and mixing anything in a bowl on the floor is not a good thing to teach.",
