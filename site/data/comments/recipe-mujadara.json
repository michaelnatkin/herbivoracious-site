Cook plenty of onions in olive oil until deep brown color, (you don't want to burn the onion), then add enough water to cook the rice and lentil with) and boil the water. This becomes your broth. DO cook the lentils separately first, but not all the way, and then combine the rice, semi cooked lentils with enough of this prepared \"onion broth\", as if cooking pilaf. Of course add salt and pepper to taste. I top the musaddara with Laban.",

Cooking the rice and lentils separately made it easier to use the right ratio (I'm bad at judging how much dry beans/lentils will turn into when cooked). I mixed the caramelized onions in with the rice/lentils to make it more kid friendly, and removed the cinnamon completely. I served mine with prepared tahini (mixed with cumin, lemon juice, water, salt, za'atar) and steamed beets with their greens. Mmmmmmm.\n\nToo bad the leftovers got eaten too- now I can't make the soup.",

Like other commenters, I added more more cumin and cinnamon. And more caramelized onions.\n\nI'm curious about your suggestion not to use French lentils. That's what I used and it turned out great. Are you talking about the dark brown Puy lentils? They hold their shape really well . . .",

It is more subtle, mainly just about the balance between the earthy lentils, comforting rice, and sweet/savory onions.

Always served it with Cucumber/Laban/garlic (yogurt) cold salad and hot baked Pita bread. Sooooooooooo  good.  Left overs reheated is great also.",
