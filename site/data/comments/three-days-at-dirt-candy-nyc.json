      "content": "well, getting Christmtas dinner for 3 on the table all together is 'interesting' enough, especially with stepson spending the afternoon updating software on our computers! Chef Amanda has my full admiration - and the BBW carrot bao sound wonderful, but jalapeno-flavored hushpuppies - I refuse to return to a particular steakhouse because of their jalapeno-flavored hushpuppies, about which (and the green chile in the German potato salad, and a few other unnecessary hot-pepper additions) the menu said NOTHING.  I hope everybody who eats at Dirty Candy understands beforehand what is meant by \"innovative.\"",

There are actually a few restaurants out there that do have the necessary equipment and operational station to do their thing but fails to deliver for they lack in the individual talented minds that'll make the food they serve magical.\n\nSurely Dirty Candy NYC is a great shop, for most, if not all, of the shops out there that started out as small-scale have quite of a reputation of serving good food!",

Top notch service and food, I'll definitely come back for more! Though one comment, an increase in accommodation would definitely be appreciated. Since at the present, they can only seat 20 or so people.",
