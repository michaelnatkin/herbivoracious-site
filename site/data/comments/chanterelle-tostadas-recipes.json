      "content": "Hi Michael, I liked your old blog's look too. New one looks crisp and fresh, suits me. :)\n\nOh Chanterelle! Pretty  mushroom with a lot of flavor, need I say I love it?! I see the cooking time only 5 minutes. Is it enough? I cook chanterelle not less than 30 minutes (wild mushrooms rule for me). I need to try your version next time. \nI was taking the I-90 exit from Bellevue and saw a sign: Wild Mushroom Festival in October. Came home and checked, yes, there it is:http://www.psms.org/show.php Should be an interesting event.",

      "content": "I do enjoy mushrooms \"hammered\" for 30 minutes as well. For this particular dish, I was using very small mushrooms and wanted them to retain their shape somewhat, so I went with a shorter cook time at a high temp to quickly develop flavor and drive off some moisture. But the approach you are talking about is totally valid! Thanks for the tip about the festival, too.",
