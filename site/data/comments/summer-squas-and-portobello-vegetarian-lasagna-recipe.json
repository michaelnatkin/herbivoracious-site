Looks like a great recipe - I might mix and match it a bit with the original spinach recipe, it's just the end of winter here and I've still got a lot of spinach and silver beet to get through!",

      "content": "Hey Rita -\n\nThe situation is actually a little more complicated than that. You are quite right that Parmigiano Reggiano is made with animal rennet, because it is a DOP product so the formula is never changed; this is true of many European cheeses. Many other cheeses, especially higher volume ones, are made using microbial or vegetable rennet these days because it is less expensive. It can be challenging to find out exactly what is used in what cheese though. Stores with knowledgeable cheesemongers may know. I bought a very nice aged cow's milk cheese that was similar in style to Parmigiano Reggiano at Whole Foods last week, but unfortunately I can't think of the name of it to pass on right now. I'll try and remember to add it here next time I see it.\n\n- Michael",

You have the same prep time for both this and the spinach and ricotta lasagna, even though this one requires frying six squash + six large portobellos until well browned.  The frying alone -- in a large skillet, without crowding the pan -- has taken me so long that I have just put two frozen pizzas in the oven for tonight's dinner because the lasagna will not be done in time.  I'm sure the lasagna will be delicious, but I won't find out tonight.  Sigh.",

      "content": "Hey Sheela - I'm sorry this didn't work out well for you, at least today. That prep time seems about right to me; possibly your skillet might not be hot enough? It should just be 2 or 3 minutes per side to brown the vegetables, and maybe two batches each of squash and mushrooms. But of course prep times are just approximations, they will always vary per person. I hope you are able to finish cooking it tomorrow!",

      "content": "Hi Michael, thanks, I did finish making the dish last night, and it turned out well.  One thought: I appreciated the photo showing how well-browned the squash should be, but it might have been even more useful if that photo had shown them in the pan.  I only did about 5-6 zucchini slices per batch in my pan because any more than that would have felt crowded, but that meant that I did almost ten batches altogether.  It took over an hour!  You must have either had more slices per batch or a much bigger pan.  I also would have liked to see a general guideline in terms of baking time, if only to help me plan ahead.  I think your recipes might be a bit advanced for me, but I guess that gives me something to work toward!  Thanks again.",

I'm also thinking that maybe 1/8\" isn't an accurate measurement I've given, because now that I think about it, that would mean you'd end up with an awful lot of slices. Thank you for the feedback!",
