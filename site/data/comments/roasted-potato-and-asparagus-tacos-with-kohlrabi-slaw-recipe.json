      "content": "wow, this is one of the best veggie taco recipes I've seen! I totally agree about the Whole Foods tortillas. Last time I used them they almost ruined the whole meal. Making them from scratch is super easy, and they freeze well too. Thanks for the great recipe.",

      "content": "What an original combination, very fresh and perfect for summer...makes me wish I hadn't already roasted the kohlrabi I picked up at the farmer's market yesterday!  You're definitely right about the Whole Foods tortillas.  I'm glad Chris decided he had to learn to make his own several months ago. Come to think of it, he hasn't made them for awhile.  I'll have to fix that.",

Glad to hear I'm not the only one who thinks those Whole Foods corn tortillas are awful! @heidi - there is a tortilleria in a Mexican grocery in White Center I think that is really good, and El Puerco Lloron in the market makes great ones for their restaurant... I think u can buy them to go though overpriced.",
