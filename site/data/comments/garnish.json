      "content": "Lovely thought provoking post Michael.I must say, plating food in context to both garnishes and food styling is not my strong point. In fact, I think I'm actually in the developmentally delayed category. A sprig of parsley is being super creative that day for me. So this has been a subject dear and sore to my heart. That said, I do love using fresh herbs in a million ways. Also smoked paprika is my superstar. I love it love it love it. Thanks for the great post.",

Every family makes a slightly different dough, but it is the cooking method that counts here :-)\n\nciao\nA.",
