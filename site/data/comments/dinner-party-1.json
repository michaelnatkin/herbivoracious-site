      "content": "Thanks! I should have mentioned that I blogged about how to make the caviar itself previously. Here's <a href=\"https://herbivoracious.com/2008/03/blini-with-aspa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the link</a>. As you can see, I improved the technique so they come out pretty transparent now. I use a Champion juicer to make the juice, skim off any foam, strain it through a succession of sieves and then double layers of cheesecloth. Then after mixing it with the alginate, I let it sit 24 hours in the fridge for the bubbles to work their way out, and skim again.",

How did you manage the menu - did you have to make things a few days before?  Also, did you have help plating?  Menu sounds wonderful, I'm sure your guests were wowed!",

      "content": "Thanks Alpa! That's correct, I did do the asparagus caviar previously. The ones in this picture are the culmination of several attempts to improve the flavor and clarity. As far as the menu goes, I made a prep list and figured out which things could be done in advance with no loss of quality, and which things had to be last minute. My friend Patrick from Cafe Flora came in as sous chef and did the final cooking and plating with me, in the back room. It was great fun!",
