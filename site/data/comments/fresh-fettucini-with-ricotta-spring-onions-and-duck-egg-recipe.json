      "content": "Made this tonight. It was wonderful. Had a few substitutions. I replaced the basil pasta with a low carb tofu pasta that I had on hand. I also used shallots since I had those. I basted rather than covered the eggs and when I finished up I drizzled white truffle oil over each plate. The results were outstanding. I just need to remember to allot a bit more time for the cheese to come up to room temp. Thank you so much for this dish idea!",
