      "content": "It is a good idea to buy a pumpkin that is known to be good for baking; anyone working in a produce department should be able to steer you towards it. Then just be careful cutting it up, be sure your hands are always out of the direction of danger in case you slip. Oh, and use your biggest spoon for scooping out the seeds once it is halved or quartered. Good luck!",
