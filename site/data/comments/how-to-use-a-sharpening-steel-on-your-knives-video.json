      "content": "Hey Michael,\n\nThat's a great video on how to sharpen knives using steel.\n\nI know with experience that it requires a lot of practice to ensure that you get the angle right. That's when you will actually get your knives sharpened.\n\nElse, as you suggested - it's a good bet to go with the electric knife sharpener",

In his paper description would you not then want to bend that overlapping potion back by dragging the blade of the knife away and against the honing steel and not pushing it with it?",
