      "content": "Hey Michael,\nthese noodles look amazing! I have recently started eating Kosher- basically vegetarian and this looks like a great dish to try out. I'm kind of unfamiliar with the Korean ingredients. Where can I find them? Any tips? I have a blog called Nosh and Tell with my friend Whitney (also a southerner and user of y'all). Check it out! Thanks for the great recipe!\nAriel Kanter\n<a href=\"http://noshandtell.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://noshandtell.blogspot.com/</a>",

      "content": "Hi Ariel - yes, being vegetarian makes being Kosher pretty darn easy, right?\nI really don't know NYC at all, but I'm sure there is a Korea Town where\ngochujang will be as common as fake maple syrup at Denny's. Soba can be had\nat either Japanese or Korean grocers. I imagine a larger Asian grocery of\nany nationality might have both of them - that is the case at Uwajimaya in\nSeattle. Can any NYC readers point Ariel in a more specific direction?",

      "content": "There is an H-Mart (a korean grocery) on 32nd st between broadway and fifth ave. It's a small store and you can find all the korean ingredients there. If having trouble, it's best to ask some customers around you b/c it's a really tight space!\n\nHope this helps",
