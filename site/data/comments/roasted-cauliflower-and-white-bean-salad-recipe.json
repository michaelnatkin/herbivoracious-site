I used some romanesco broccoli today to make vegetable+rice balls and baked some cauliflower with a cramy saffron sauce. I think the cabbage family is great but I'm really looking forward to some nice spring veggies.",

      "content": "Who doesn't love roasted cauliflower?!  And your twist with beans and Orange Olive Oil sounds delicious.  This recipe is definitely going on my must-try list!\n\nIt makes such a difference to use an olive oil that is flavored by \"co-pressing\" (like the one you recommended) versus \"infusing\".  Pressing just-harvested olives with fresh fruit creates an amazing bright, natural flavor.  An infused olive oil is flavored after-the-fact (e.g., with extracts) which shortens shelf life.  To me, infused olive oils just don't taste nearly as pure.  Sounds as if you may agree?\n\nI own a small business, The Olive Orchard, and we are passionate about sharing the remarkable flavor of single-origin extra virgin olive oils. All of our flavored olive oils are naturally co-pressed with fresh fruits & herbs (crafted by the Laleli estate on the Turkish Mediterranean). Customers have been crazy about our cute, little Flavored Sampler Set...great way to have fun in the kitchen and experiment with all six flavored olive oils.\n\nThanks for your post!  My apologies for being a little long-winded.  Just excited to find your blog!  Now I will subscribe and follow for easier access to your foodie fun :).\n\n<a href=\"http://theoliveorchard.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://theoliveorchard.com</a>",
