One of my goals this year is to 'make' pasta. I'm not sure I will be able to make either type of pasta, but if I do make any pasta, I think I will use this sauce!\n\nLovely!",

I used a dry white wine, because after researching how to store vermouth, I realized my vermouth has been sitting in the wine rack, unrefrigerated, for the past month or so.  Note to self:  buy new bottle of vermouth, store in fridge after opening.  Thanks for your wonderful recipe...my sons are quite the food critics and they could not get enough of this pasta dish!",
