      "content": "Now everyone will know our secret! Those of us who are lousy crimpers make crostatas. In all fairness I told my husband before we married that my pies look rather sad. He married me based on my crostada. I fill mine with grilled veggies and cheese, but I've never tried peach. Will give it a go and let you know. I bet vanilla ice cream is lovely with this. Looks like a weekend project! Thanks!",

      "content": "Michael- I made this and brought it to a potluck, it was a great hit! I didn't have nectarines, just Maryhill peaches, it was delovely anyway. I added the innards of 1/2 of a vanilla bean to the peaches, cuz you know, that's how I roll. But I followed everything else to the letter and it was really yummy and easy. One guest at the potluck asked if I might be able to bottle the caramelized peach juices that oozed out one corner. He said he'd pay me a million dollars for a liter of it.  Thanks for making me look good!",

The crust was flaky, and the peach/butter/sugar combination for the filling created these pockets of sweet-tart peachy jam. Thank you so much for this recipe. It was a huge hit, and will be part of my regular not-pie repertoire.",

Here aunt used to make THE BEST pastry crusts. They would melt in your mouth! So \"almost there\" is really a great compliment. Thanks for sharing the recipe, it was yummy, yummy!!",

The inner part where the fruit resides had a lot of liquid left over when it finished baking. i actually had to use a baster to take some out so the thing wouldn't fall apart. should i let the peaches sit with some sugar before i put in them in the pastry next time?",

I am among those who cannot make a \"pretty\" pie.  I may never bake a conventional pie again - the textures were gorgeous & complementary - not too sweet and it allowed the fruit to be fruit (I did grind some cinnamon over it).  Am now pondering a crostata with apples, onions and raisins...",
