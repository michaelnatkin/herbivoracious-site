I'm a big fan of any kind of sable cookie too - in fact <a href=\"https://herbivoracious.com/2007/08/foodbeam-sables.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the first one I made</a> was based on Fanny's recipe - chocolate with fleur de sel. I could totally see how the whole wheat would work, adding something like an english biscuit aspect. Yum.",
