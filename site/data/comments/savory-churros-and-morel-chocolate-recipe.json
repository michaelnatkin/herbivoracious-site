      "content": "Sounds great. I've been working on a vegan marshmallow recipe and so far have had 2 failures (using different starches) and 1 semi success. The one I made with agar (kelp) foamed up properly but it didn't have the right texture (more like meringue than marshmallow). I've added lecithin to my stable though so I may retry some of the past attempts with the stabilizer.",
