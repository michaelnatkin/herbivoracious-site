It's richer with the stock but it's pretty darn good even with just water.  However I don't discard the parmesan rind after the soup is cooked - I eat it!\n\nThis soup also serves as a really good base for a poached egg.",

      "content": "I'm interested in your claim that tomato-based stuff (or other food) tastes better a day later. I instinctively agreed, but I also have some doubts. Maybe it tastes better because it's already prepared and you don't have to do all that work, for instance. Maybe (for lasagna) it tastes better because the re-heating makes the surface just a tiny bit crispier, etc. I'd like to figure out a reasonable way to do an A/B test of this. Any thoughts?",

The flavors meld and have time to think about being together, which makes for better eating.\n\nI am fighting a nasty virus and don't have the energy to cook. I LOATHE canned soup. Would you be so kind as to put some of this minestrone in an envelope and send it to me? Thanks!",

So I guess we&#39;ll get two can of the same brand of tomato sauce and make 3 samples:\n\n\n\n\n(1) Open on day 1, aerate, refrigerate\n\n(2) Open on day 1, heat, aerate, refrigerate\n\n(3) Leave unopened in refrigerator\n\n\n\nSeasoning them all with the same amount of salt. Then on day 2, we&#39;ll open can 3 and taste them all blind and see if we can determine a difference. If there is a difference, then we&#39;d have to dive deeper to determine the chemistry. I gotta try this.",
