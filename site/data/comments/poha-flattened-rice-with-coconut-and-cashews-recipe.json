It feels so good to know someone who doesnt punish me for being vegetarian, instead helps me celebrate it!.\nPoha is one of my absolute favorite breakfast/snack items. Its light, fluffy and flavourful! Also I love to squeeze a little fresh lime juice over my poha. It gives a fresher and better taste than lime pickle.",

Additionally I read your 'why I'm vegetarian, damn it' and I found it very compelling and thought provoking.  I recently began a blog, and I'm vegan, so it's wonderful to read other people's perspective.\n\nI look forward to your cookbook.\n\nHealthy Regards,\n\n~RAM~",

The Asian grocer I go to from time to time had poha so I snatched some up, but I don't remember ever seeing it there before. Think I'm going to love your recipe, but I'm also thinking poha could be a great  'pantry' staple at work, sort of like couscous. Just rehydrate, add some seasonings, dried fruit and nuts? Instant pilaf when you forgot to bring lunch!",

My only problem is that the poha ended up pretty dry for me ... should I have left it soaking in the water a bit longer? I still have half of the dish left for dinner tomorrow night ... I'm thinking I might throw it into a skillet with some broth to reheat/moisten it a bit. A good idea?",

I suspect rewarming it with a bit more liquid will be fine. I could actually see the microwave with a couple tablespoons of water in a covered dish working well.",

Your  enfrijoladas de espinaca became a family favorite and I think this one will, too.",

      "content": "Yum! One of my favorite breakfasts! I usually stick to just onion, peas and maybe potatoes for the veggies. The best thing about poha is that it's so forgiving--even if you don't have any vegetables, it's still delicious!  Although, I don't soak my poha--too much of a chance of it falling apart. Instead, I just put it in a colander and \"rinse\" it thoroughly. Once in the tawa, I add a little more water and cover it to let it steam.",

      "content": "Poha is a staple breakfast item for most Indians and there are different versions of it. I love the way Gujaratis make their Poha by adding a little sugar, mustard seeds, very little turmeric and no veggies but I never get it quite right. \nSo i stick to my version with lots of onion, coriander, tomatoes and potatoes. While tempering,  curry leaves and green chillies can also be added if you can handle the heat! And I like to garnish it sometimes with raw onions too. \nHowever I like my Poha very mushy because otherwise it becomes too dry for my taste.",
