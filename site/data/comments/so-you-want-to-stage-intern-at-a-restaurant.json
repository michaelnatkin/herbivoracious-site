Our prereq was 2 food science courses with their labs. At the time, I thought it was a total waste of time and labor (we ran a once per week nutrition \"restaurant\"), Little did I know how useful and amazing this chance was and how much I learned from it.  \n\nWhat a great and useful post!",

So show up early and fully prepared on the day you re-agreed to and kick ass and it may still work out. And if not, find another restaurant and try again!",

      "content": "Another question.. Im a Culinary Arts/Baking and Pastry Arts student , but no experience in any restaurant.. since I was not succesful at landing a job as a prep cook or Line cook I was willing to take any position even as a dishwasher in a newly open French restaurant and I did.. In My mind I was looking forward of moving my way up like other chefs have done.. I don't like to mention racism because I dont even want to believe it exist..but at the moment I arrived my first day there were a pile of dishes from the previous dishwashers that had quit the first day 2 of them and that restaurant had been opened 2 days.. I took my my job seriously and immediately started doing my job... there wasn't a system set up yet and I noticed I needed extra help at least for the 2-3 busy hours.. but I didn't complain.. what I did suggested were more racks for extra storage because I wasnt able to continue my flow and I couldnt' finish alll the dishes by the end of the day.. for 8.5 hours I have not even taken a restoom break or any break at all .. I asked the manager if I could come in earlier the next day to organize and finish since the restaurant is open from 5-10pm.. he said \"no just come in at 4pm\" the next day I planned on organizing and setting up a system where I can communicate with the bussers, waiters and bartenders so that we can work together on where the y needed me or I needed them to place dishes and pans ..etc ..started working more efficiently but again when it got busy nobody cared and everything got piled up again.. still no extra storage... and again i couldn't finish so the schef at the end came up to me and asked \"why so many dishes\" so I explained.. he didn't say anything and told me it was closing time and said \"Se\u00f1or! you need to finish tommorow before closing!\" and spoke to me in Spanish as if not he will hire someone else.. I will continue my job today but what can I do?..Just keep my head down? I know I could get faster by time but they haven't done their part by adding another dishwasher or extra racks.",

      "content": "Hey Diego -\n\nI have a few thoughts here, and I'll also see if I can get some folks with more industry experience than me to weigh in.\n\n(1) To me, it sure sounds like the chef made an assumption based on the color of your skin that you didn't speak English. That's obnoxious. It is true that there are certainly a lot of non-English speaking dishwashers in the industry, but that had to feel crappy when you've made a conscious choice to try and work your way up from the dishroom and the first thing you face is that kind of assumption.\n\n(2) It is entirely common in the industry for facilities not to be optimized to make jobs as efficient as they could be. I think it is fine to make a suggestion, but on the other hand if it is your first day or two in a professional kitchen, it might be the case that you need to just work with what is available for now. And especially, this is a restaurant that is literally brand new, they probably aren't thinking the dish system is their biggest problem right now. \n\n(3) Even though it might seem like the dishpit isn't a real high skill position, there is still a lot of knowledge and speed that comes with time on the job, so it is kind of a crappy situation for you to be in there on your own, with  no-one experienced to show you the ropes.\n\n(4) To me it is shortsighted of that manager, if you are offering to come in an hour early and get things organized, to say no to that kind of initiative.\n\nBottom line - my guess is that if you've decided to try and work your way up from dishwasher, you'll have to make a call as to whether that can happen in this kitchen or not. But actually I think you'd be better off asking to stage somewhere better, working as an extra hand for free on prep and garde mange and get in the door that way.",

      "content": "Diego- I am a professional pastry chef, working 14 hours a day, which is probably about 6 less than anyone in a managerial position who is opening a restaurant. I barely had the time/patience to read your lenghtey comment. Don't take this as an insult. But this industry moves FAST, and the higher up you get, the less time you have for details like the racks in a dish pit. The best dishwashers out there come in, blow through your dishes without speaking, finish, and go home. Strike that. They go to a second job somewhere. You're jumping in with grand intentions, but into a position where the standard has been set by people who work like maniacs, don't ask questions, and always get their job done.  \n\nIf you are feeling injured on your second day by your bosses attitude, maybe this isn't the right way for you to enter the industry. Take it as a lesson, the dishwasher is the most overworked, thankless job in an industry filled with overworked thankless jobs. \n\nI've been through restauarant openings. It's not just that there's no system for the dishes yet, there's not a system for anything, and the dish pit is low on the priority list, behind how to get the food cooked, and how to get it to the customer. \n\nIf the interaction you described made you feel injured, you either need a big lesson in sucking it up, (this is not being mean, this is absolutely necessary for a career in restaurants) or you need a more gentle introduction to the industry. You're going to be that chef someday, who only needs to know one thing. You have dishes, they need to get done between the hours of 4 and 12, and you need someone to do it. It won't be personal, it's a yes or no question. Will they do it for you or won't they. \n\nEither put your head down, learn to work with what you have, and stick it out, using it as practice for the years of grueling thankless overworked underaccommodated hours you are about to endure as a line cook, OR go get a slower more delicate start by offering your unskilled hands for free as a stage. You will likely find that about 1000 times more satisfying. But the same lesson applies, keep your head down, push through, and work with what they give you. \n\nYou are a culinary student. you don't have to scrub yourself out of the dish pit into a prep cook job if you don't want to. You have educated yourself and have other ways into kitchens.",

Since I live in London I made a list of the best restaurants at the moment and then went through the list for restaurants I really liked (because of their style, product, menus, etc.). I obviously ended up with an extremely long list but nevertheless started writing them all telling them about my enthusiasm, motivation, why I like them, etc. This week I got my first reply back and HOERAAH for me cause I can start with a week in September.

I'd keep it really brief - just tell them who you are, what your experience (both school and work) is, and when and how long you'd like to stage for if it is possible (including whatever flexibility you have on dates).

      "content": "Hi Michael,\n     I made a comment here before on 6/30/14.  I just wanted to let you know that I started a PT internship last weekend!  My schedule is weekends and one weeknight.  I am very excited about this because I never worked in a professional kitchen before plus I don't have to quit my job.  I am an avid cook at home though and really work on perfecting every dish I make.  I seem to be convinced that cooking is something that I can do for the rest of my life.  But I am sort of testing the waters via this gig just in case I may be wrong :-).  \n     Anyway, I really think the first day was the hardest part because I had no clue what I was getting myself into.  My biggest worry was whether I would be able to stay standing for several hours and not my basic kitchen skills and knowledge or lack thereof.  \n     So what have I learned? (0) First, let me describe how I got the internship.  I went to one of the restaurants on my favorite restaurant list (between 3-4 pm) and filled out an application.  I asked to talk to the chef but he was in a meeting for a while so I just said that I was going to come back.  I didn't go back :-) but instead wrote a very carefully written honest email to the restaurant.  I got an interview, followed up after over a week, and was told to come in to start the internship :-) (1) Things happen really fast so listen carefully and ask for clarification if it's not clear to you when you are given instructions. (2) It's true what they say that there are many Spanish speaking people who work BOH :-) They work really quickly!  But they were also very nice and helpful.  One of them helped me a lot when the Chef was busy.  (3)  Being nice and helpful to everyone around you can do wonders! (4)  Working hard can do wonders! (4) The first day is the most difficult for the body.  If you are like me who has a regular job sitting down working in front of a computer, then working in a professional kitchen will shock your body!  And this is even though I work out at the gym and play sports regularly!  I had to take a painkiller pill before going to bed :-( The second day, my body was fine :-) (5) Now I know what the sharpie is for - labeling prepped food that is put in storage or later use!  (6) Crocs Bistro Clogs are great!  (7) Work fast but carefully.\n       These are just some of my initial thoughts after only 2 days of working so some of them may change in time :-)  I'm already looking forward to the next time I'll be at the restaurant!\n       Btw, thanks again for all your very helpful thoughts and insights on staging.  I'm also thankful to everyone who made comments especially Nico from The Fit Duck.  I read all (!) his blog entries and it helped me gain some rather interesting insights about working in BOH.  I also appreciate his effective use of emoticons :-).\n       Again, thanks!  I'll be stopping by here again sometime to report about my future experiences :-).",

That job, too, was a \"Sir, I don't know anything about pastry, but I'll gladly chop vegetables and prep for you, if you'll only let me hang out in the pastry department in my off time to learn more.\"  \n\nI suppose I got lucky with a couple of chefs who were willing to take a chance on an eager 24 year old who was willing to put himself out there. \n\nWhat I like best about your article is that it's more than just a description on how to get a good stage, it's also a great list of hints on how to start your first kitchen experience, paid or not.  Some chefs use the stage as an interview tool, and others are happy to just let someone come in and hang out (read:  work hard) for awhile to learn.  Whatever your goal, these are excellent pointers to aspiring young chefs!",

Do you think that means I will still have to cut/cook etc? or do you think I will just be shadowing? I am waiting for them to email me more information, but the more I read it seems like everyone stages for longer than one day?\nthoughts?\n\nMelissa",

Until this summer, when I had no job during college vaccation and I replied to a job offering (for 3 months) that a guy from my school posted on facebook.. In a restaurant, as a cook. I went there and just told them: \"I've never worked in a kitchen before, and since I'm only used to baking cakes and making sweets my cooking skills are seriously lacking. BUT I'm really eager to learn and work hard\" I got hired :) After the 3 months my classes started and they asked me to stay ( but working less hours because of school). Be humble and hard working and they'll respect you!",

But I got the job, yay, so happy &amp; loving it every day! Extremely hard work, physically demanding, but truly awesome experience to work in a kitchen full time &amp; learn from an awesome chef &amp; sous chef! Actually, I learn from everyone in the kitchen...about 20-30 new things a day...little &amp; big pieces of advice that I didn't necessarily learn at culinary school (once you're in their kitchen, new rules &amp; interesting ways of doing things \"their way\" seem to come up daily)! But no matter how tired I am or how hard the day is, I find myself smiling from ear to ear as I get in my car to go home. I never thought I could be so happy at a job &amp; it's so satisfying on so many levels. Anyway, this really is great advice. I'm going to keep reading what you recommended b/c, like you said, it's inspiring &amp; always interesting to hear what the more experienced have to offer. Thank you for such a thoughtful, well-written &amp; helpful post!!",

I am a fairly accomplished home chef and as a hobby I arrange food and wine pairing parties for 30 to 50 people where i do most of the recipe development and the cooking.  At my last party the executive chef of a well regarded local restaurant attended one of my dinners as the guest of one of my regulars. I was very nervous having a real chef at my table, and to my surprise he asked me to do a pop up with him. When I told him I had no restaurant experience, he asked me to stage at his place.  Subsequently another guest who is a food photographer introduced me to two of his clients, one of whom is well connected to Thomas Keller.  Both of these clients suggested we do a pop up together in the near future.  It's like a dream come true but I am also terrified at the prospect because I have no professional experience.  What in your opinion are the top things you would recommend I learn to successfully maneuver the pop up experience? I know how to cook but have no experience dealing with the fast pace of a typical service and maneuvering through the various roles in a commercial kitchen. How many weeks (months?) do you think an appropriate stage would take for me to learn these things?",

I would say that if you are already preparing and cooking for 30-50 people, that basically is a popup! So you are well on your way. I'd take that opportunity to stage, preferably for a week more. Other than that, the key to a popup is really the same as any other restaurant situation: preparation. Make those lists, check them and check them again, do everything you possibly can in advance, work clean, pack up all the prep really neatly, make sure you have everything you need for chilling, heating, finishing, serving. Make sure you have all the help you need for final cooking, service and cleanup. Just be incredibly organized so that you aren't improvising when it is time to serve, and it should all go great.",

I have had the privilege of working with some of the best chefs' in this country by doing apprenticeships during summer breaks. I've been offered a stage at Noor Restaurant in Cordoba,Spain which is a one Michelin currently. The chef is Paco Morales who has worked at El Bulli and Mugaritz amongst others and is bringing back the cuisine of the Arab Moors who ruled Spain during 12th century. \nDo you think it is a good decision to start my career with a stage. From among the chefs I've spoken to hear about the same, some said it is better I work a year or two somewhere here and then move on to a stage while some said this is the best time because you're young and you have age on your side and later you might have other commitments. I personally want to do this stage because I never apply for it and it just came my way while having a chat with Chef Paco so I am very sure I'd regret not doing it. Please do get back thank you. \n\nP.S The article you've written is amazing. Truly catches the essence of working at a restaurant from what I've experienced. Cheers!",

As someone who was supposed to go into law, but ended up as a Chef/Somm, I would highly suggest finding similar cases where the restaurant won their case. You will need these to prove in Civil Court why no value should be awarded to the disgruntled individual. Using these past cases as an example helps solidify your arguments in front of the judge.
