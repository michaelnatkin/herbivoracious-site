      "content": "May I give you some recommendations for where else to eat?  I've just returned from two years in J'lem...\n\nfor falafel and fantastic Hummus, go walk in the Jaffa gate, down the main steps of the Arab shuk (market), take the first or second left towards Church of the Holy Sepulchur, then take a right down the major alleyway parallel to the main steps until you hit Lena on your right.  (Ask for directions -- it's a go-to spot for everyone in the market).  They have fantastic, ever-so-fresh hummus and great falafel.  Hit up Jafaar Sweets for dessert -- it's a little deeper in the shuk, but anyone can direct you there. it's a hotspot. enjoy!\n\nalso, for great veggie fare, go to the Village Green on Jaffa street.",
