Does anyone share the love for these cuisines and if so, what similarities do they share with Indian?  Any commonalities I should look for in flavors or textures?",

      "content": "Of the three, I would say the most similar is Thai for the shared love of spices, but even then the flavor profiles and cooking methods are pretty different. My suggestion would be to go eat at an Indian restaurant (preferably a few times) and see how you like the flavors. This will give you a good sense of what you are aiming for if you decide you'd like to cook this cuisine at home. If you do decide to try, I think you will find it to be very interesting and rewarding.",
