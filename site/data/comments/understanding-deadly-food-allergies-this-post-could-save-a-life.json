      "content": "Fantastic article! I don't myself have any serious allergies, but I'm a waitress, haven't work much as one but I always try to ask what they use, for instance, I know a lot of Asian cooking use rice or other gluten free flour in the deep fried mix, and when working in an Indian restaurant they didn't use wheat flour for deep frying or anything else there. Good to know!\n\nI do have IBS/irritable bowel, so certain things make me worse. The doctor even thought it could be celiacs at first, because I got so much better without wheat. So I know how to read labels! And have read a lot about several food allergies. It's just ridiculus to give an answer without thinking, or the waiters don't ask at all. They should be fired! Or forced to drive the person to the hospital, to wait there with them and see the agony. I get enough agony with \"just\" an irritable bowl.  Luckely I know a lot about food and wheat is farly noticable. Only problems are sauces and stuff like that, but that's not enough to make me really ill if I'm having one of those days.. Just avoid bread with the soup, and I'll be fine.\n\nAnd by the way, you talk about peanuts like they are nuts. Peanuts are in fact a legume (look it up in wiki of you want!), so people with peanut allergy, can usually eat nuts. And the other way around. But some, like your wife, can't eat legumes nor nuts. So that causes some problems and confusion. It's a shame to avoid ALL nuts just because you can't eat peanuts. And to then be scared to death when eating out. Remember that!",

From my\nperspective, I want everyone's health issues to be treated with respect, and\non the other hand I know that it is difficult for most restaurants to\nfunction if every ticket involves special requests, so it is important to\nprioritize those requests that are very serious or life threatening over\nmilder consequences. I think it basically comes down to individual\nconscience and comfort in the discussion you have with your server.",

      "content": "This is a great article...as always. Sorry to hear of your recent experience.\n\nFor those with such life threatening allergies, a suggestion I have is to carry postcards/3x5 cards with the exact allergens on them to hand to the wait staff to be passed to the kitchen staff with the order for your table. It may also be possible to ask your doctor for a similar size card with the information on it and their signature in order to emphasize the point.\n\nWith the electronic ordering systems in place, this may require a \"special\" trip to the kitchen, but would also aid in making the point and getting the attention needed to the order.\n\nAlthough I know many people who do not want to bring undue attention to themselves and their food allergies, I believe bringing attention to the situation in order to avoid the hasty departure/giving an epi shot etc. is the preferable route.",

      "content": "As a restaurant worker for the past 20 years both FOH and BOH, and someone with a (albeit minor)shellfish allergy, I have to say this is a great article! May I add a couple small points?\n\nWhen working as a chef, I have always, always really appreciated a customer detailing any allergy requirements when they make their reservation, if at all possible. The chef is much better able to make accomodations when they know ahead of time, and the customer can be much more secure in the special preparations of the dish if the cooks aren't in the weeds when they prep for it. Even if a restaurant doesn't make reservations, calling ahead to let the kitchen know you're coming makes a world of difference in their ability to make accomodations. We want to make you happy, and keep you safe! Calling ahead helps us help you.\n\nFor chefs: Set aside your egos and willing to make a dish differently. Sometimes a lot differently! If a customer brings in their own pasta and asks you to cook it due to a wheat allergy, for crying out loud don't cook it the same water! Same goes for their veggies. You have no idea how many times I've seen chefs do things like throw veggies for a fish allergy ticket into a steamer previously used for lobster. Silly as it may seem to the cook, it is not silly for the customer.\n\nThanks for this! I know that all too many of my peers don't take allergies seriously unless they suffer from them also.",

Hopefully people in the food industry will take it to heart!  Thanks for writing it!",

      "content": "I've had very similar experiences, and found the recommended advice to restaurant workers very useful. At the moment I'm 24 hours into a pine nut allergy attack from being poisoned at a Spanish restaurant in Oakland where we discussed the menu and my allergy in detail with the waiter. My wife saw the pine nuts in a meatball dish after I'd taken a bite. We rushed to the hospital and were in the ER before the symptoms were serious. The symptoms struck twice with increasing severity two, and then three hours later, inside the ER. They had refrained from giving me epinephrine at first, because of a fear of endangering my heart. The result: the allergy progressed to a crisis phase with only the benadryl and prednisone treatment. After the second alarming rush of heat, perspiration, and inability to breathe, they did give me the epi, and things subsided. All told I was in the ER for ten hours before being released. Now 24 hours after first contact with the pine nuts, I'm still taking benadyl and still flushed.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty furious at the waiter, who could have included the dish that got me when he listed the dishes containing pine nuts, but did not.\n\nI'm beginning to understand the wisdom of what Bill wrote above. Eating out is risky business.\n\nGeorge, 61 in Oakland",

      "content": "My advice as someone who has waited tables for 10+ years?  Don't trust the waitstaff.  If you have an extremely serious allergy, go straight to the top and make sure that the manager and chef on duty know of your situation.\n\nAn Asian diner I worked at had a string of people that would come in with claims of cilantro, onion, mushroom, and garlic allergies.  Is it possible all these people had these allergies?  Sure.  Is it possible that some of these people had an aversion to these foods and claimed they were allergic for extra security to try and keep them out of their dinner?  You betcha.  Annoying.  Translation:  servers hear countless dramatic tales of food woe every day.  They aren't paid to take each one of these as their personal cause.  Managers are!\n\nI saw countless waiters/aspiring actors/college coed fellow employees of mine edit tickets with NO CILANTRO or NO PEANUT at which point the kitchen staff/recent immigrants/college coed back of the house would prepare the dish as per usual and then leave of the cilantro or peanut or whatever that was PART OF THE GARNISH.  Never mind the cilantro and peanuts that were cooked into the soup, spring roll, etc.\n\nPersonally, I would never deliver a plate to a guest with the claim that it was 'allergen free' despite what I may have been told about it.  If I didn't make it, I'm not going to make any promises about it.  Do you wanna know how many times I've delivered a steak that I was told was 'well done' that was sent back bloody?  Same principle.\n\nIn my current position I hear my fellow employees incorrectly describe menu ingredients to their guests EVERY DAY.  I'm sure I've unintentionally done it myself on occasion, and I consider myself to be very food savvy.  BE WARY!",

I used to feel like that pesky person asking to talk to the manager, but I know it is a matter of life and death for my son and so I don't care.  I carry a card w/ his allergies written out and ask the manager to talk to the chef to see what they recommend. In some of the restaurants (such as Disneyland) the chef will come out and talk to us and give my son options. Then after deciding we talk about cross contamination.  Thank God I have had good experiences. And attentive people.  I live near Six Flags Magic Mountain and my son loves to eat their French Fries, there is only one restaurant there that has a dedicated fryer for them and the manager there knows us and always makes a fresh batch of fries for him.\n\nI am going to print this article and distribute it to the managers of the restaurants that I freqently go to!

That way they wait staff doesn't have to try and memorize a list of ingredients and doesn't miscommunicate to the chef. We did this after she told a waiter she was allergic to wheat and he told the kitchen she was allergic to the noodles and she ended up getting really sick from some chicken that was marinated with a wheat product. The cards are small and easy to carry, it clearly communicates the allergies to the kitchen. It is worded in a way that conveys the seriousness of her allergy and also thanks them for accomodating her. We recently started printing the same thing in Spanish on the opposite side since there is a lot of kitchen staff who don't speak English fluently.",

It is a normal part of life, and it would be a pity to miss out. Kudos for all the brave souls!\n\nI just want to throw out one problem that I have run into as a chef. Every restaurant gets at least some product whose processing they can't vouch for. When I do my absolute best to make sure that allergens are not served to allergy sufferers, that means I won't be able to use some ingredients. Is the flour we use for the pasta processed in a plant that also does nuts? It isn't labeled as such, but who really knows? Did a farm worker or delivery guy eat a peanut butter sandwich before he loaded up our order? I get very nervous serving ANYTHING, especially to nut allergen folks, because I can't guarantee the chain of processioning and distribution.\n\nHappily in 13 years, I have never had a problem.",

      "content": "Thanks very much for your article. Several people in my family have wheat allergy -- such that they have debilitating \"food poisoning\" for weeks after eating it because the immune system overreacts. The worst was a fancy restaurant that swore up and down that the chocolate mousse had no wheat at all. The next day, my mom, extremely ill, called the restaurant back and finally tracked down the head chef who admitted the mousse did have flour. Despite the best intentions of waitresses, I think it's easy sometimes for them (or the chef) to not think of something as being \"wheat\".\n\nWhat are the best experiences for us? There are so many \"hidden\" sources of wheat that be difficult for someone else to do an exhaustive search for them (ex. soy sauce, food starch and bran are all usually wheat-based). It's hard to expect someone else to know how to search food sources if they haven't dealt with a food allergy. They'll say the sauce is fine, even if they haven't looked -- because why would there be wheat in barbeque sauce or soy sauce or salad dressing? (Unfortunately, it's in a large number of processed foods) If a restaurant has the sauce bottles for the dishes we're considering or a book that lists ingredients for the dishes, we can scan it in a matter of seconds and say, \"Perfect!\" or \"These aren't safe for us. Can you just make a salad with balsamic vinegar instead, no croutons?\" I think it's a lot less running for the waittress if there's an updated binder of ingredients for each of the dishes they serve... and also a lot less scary for people who are allergic.",

I\u2019m always more stressed about it than he is; he is used to the whole ER process by now! I do miss my cashews and nutella but my boyfriend\u2019s life is worth so much more.\nWay too often people are unaware how serious this is and or just don\u2019t care; they don\u2019t want to put the extra effort into assuring the meal is nut-free or even verify if a dish has nuts in it or not. We never really had any problems with the kitchen itself or cross-contamination but rather bad waiters. A few times the waiters didn\u2019t even want to go check with the cook about the frying oil or the salad garnishes and bluntly told us to choose something else that isn\u2019t fried or a salad. I met a waiter who argued with us that pecans are not real nuts and therefore we can eat the dessert that had them. On another occasion we had to rush to the ER because a waiter assured us the dish was nut free but it contained hidden pine nuts in a pesto-type sauce. In his mind pine nuts were not really nuts like peanuts since it came from a pine tree, so he didn\u2019t mention them even after we insisted on being allergic to all and every nuts.\nWe had some wonderful waiters too over the years but the bad ones leave a more durable impression. And yes, the tips are much bigger if they make even the smallest efforts. When we notice a waiter makes real efforts we usually take his/her name and ask for that waiter the next time; so the tips keep coming too!",

      "content": "Thanks for this informative post. I hope restaurant staff everywhere read and take it to heart.\n\nOne suggestion: include sesame in your future posts on the subject. We found out the hard way that our daughter was severely allergic to all forms of sesame after feeding her tahini at 9 months. The ER staff told us that sesame allergy is on the rise in the U.S. and that it won't be long before it's in the top 10.\n\nNow that she is a toddler who eats and enjoys most everything we give her (though of course we haven't tried peanuts, nuts, or any other seeds), we're beginning to navigate the restaurant scene and finding that wait staff sometimes have no idea that sesame is used in oil form and paste form (tahini) as well as in seed form. People aren't nearly as aware or as careful with sesame as they are with nuts or peanuts, which scares the crap out of me. We made the mistake of eating at a Korean place a couple weeks ago (one of my absolute favorite foods), and after extensive discussions with the owner and the chef, ordered a sushi roll for our daughter. After she was halfway done with it, I noticed sesame seeds embedded in the rice on one of the remaining pieces. I've never felt fear like that in my gut. I guess we won't be eating at Korean restaurants ever again!\n\nThere's still hope she'll grow out of it, though a recent skin test came back very, very positive for the allergy still. In the meantime, we will definitely take your and your readers' advice to be unapologetic in our questioning.",

Most people can understand nut allergies but not that you can be allergic to a very common berry. And what is funny is that after you explain that even a tiny bit of it could possible kill me, they go 'oh so-and-so is allergic to strawberries too but they eat them anyway.' For me the issue is when desserts are ordered because strawberries are often used as a garnish.\n\nThere is one chain that my whole family can go out to eat and I can safely eat the dessert. The kitchen staff there is always happy to either leave off the sauce or use something else to garnish the plates with. And one new chain restaurant in town was super accommodating. The waitress made a special note on the order and went into the kitchen to make sure that the kitchen knew that it required special attention.\n\nI think the message is getting through in many places. But I am still very careful. I have a few favorite places where I can safely go out to eat and not have to worry about it.",

Trying to avoid a miserable reaction (ingesting corn does not result in anaphylaxis but it does make me extremely miserable for days) requires diligence and control of my surroundings. I can't imagine how anyone with a life-threatening food allergy could work up the nerve to eat out. There are so many possibilities for cross-contamination and the allergic have zero control in a restaurant situation, it seems a little too much like playing Russian roulette to me. I would like to be able to go to restaurants or buy something quick and easy for dinner occasionally, but I don't think I could ever want it enough to risk my life for it.",

We pick high end restaurants where the chef uses fresh ingredients and it's easier for the chef to prepare a safe meal for my son. We also never order desserts at any restaurants. We will also stay away from the salads too if we see they have a salad on the menu that contains nuts. We would never eat at an Asian restaurant because the risk of cross-contamination is too high. We have a restaurant card that we always give the chef and we when we make a reservation we always let them know about his allergy.\nMy son always orders meals off the adult menu too because he loves fine foods! The chef's generally enjoy cooking for him because he loves their food! We always tip a minimum of 20% and  are repeat customers to great restaurants.",

Ha ha ha.  I spend a ridiculous amount of time trying to find \"safe\" restaurants and form that safe menu items.  I barely make enough to pay my bills... but when I go out to eat, have a good time, and don't die... I tip like a madman.  Especially if I have to ask the server about any allergens and then talk to a manager or cook from there.  It's a certain level of embarrassing/awkward to bring up... even if it shouldn't be.  Anything that you do as a server to make it less awkward is REALLY appreciated, and I try to convey that in the gratuity.",

As a waiter I am never willing to tell a customer that I am 100% sure their food does not contain an allergen. As a customer I realize I am risking my health every time I eat in a restaurant that serves the food I am allergic to (mussels). Heck, I risked my health every day I went to work at a restaurant that serves them.\n\nI have had customers who claimed to have an \"allergy,\" but when they learned that meant that we would not only leave off the offending item but also be unable to serve them the sauce they wanted, the allergy mysteriously dissappeared. I have also had customers who, when they learned I could not 100% guarantee that their food was safe, refused to accept that answer and also refused to leave. I am going to do everything in my power to make sure your food is safe - but as an above poster said, I didn't harvest the food myself so I dont really know for sure. Take the risk or eat at home! At least I'm not lying to you.",

      "content": "Another allergy less known, but just as deadly, is a tick-borne allergy to anything mammal.  This allergy is caused by the the bite of a seed or deer tick.  Several years ago, I woke up during the night scratching all over from the bites of almost microscopic seed ticks.  In appearance, they resemble chiggers, but they are black instead of red.  Over the course of several months, the titer levels in my body increased resulting in an anaphylactic response about three hours after eating catered food at a banquet.  It took quite a few months of tracking everything I ate and several anaphylactic episodes with accompanying trips to the emergency room to narrow down the culprit as anything with four legs and fur.  I traveled to the University of VA for further testing and to participate in a mammalian allergy study where my suspicions as to the cause of the reaction were confirmed.  Basically what happens is that if I ingest meat, it takes about three hours to go through the digestive process.  After this amount of time, all that is left is a sugar chain called alpha-gal.  Alpha-gal so closely resembles the tick venom in chemical make-up that my body goes into anaphylactic shock.  Eating at restaurants can be very tricky, especially since so many people are unfamiliar with this allergy.  Interestingly, I can eat milk products, but cheese is an issue if it is made with animal rennet.  So just because a restaurant may say a dish is vegetarian, the cheese can still be a culprit.  Sometimes, my biggest challenge has been convincing restaurants to prepare my fish on a separate griddle from other meats.  At home we primarily eat a vegan diet now, but as there are few vegan options at most restaurants in my hometown, I am very limited in the restaurant options in our hometown.",
