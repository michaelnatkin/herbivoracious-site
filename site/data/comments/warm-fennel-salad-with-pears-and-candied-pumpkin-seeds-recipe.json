      "content": "I was once an incredibly picky omnivore, who is now transitioning and expanding into the world of vegetarianism. Just found your site and am loving it so far! I've never had fennel or candied pumpkin seeds but the picture looks delectable. As weird as it may sound, I've also never had a warm salad before. I think I'd make it with apple instead of pear, or maybe an asian (apple) pear. Thanks for the ideas!",
