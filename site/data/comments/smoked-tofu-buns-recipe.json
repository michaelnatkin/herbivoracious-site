And I'm not beyond using a camp torch to light a candle or some incense in a pinch ... but  I think I have to pass on this aparatus !  Like, Lucille Ball comes waltzing out of the kitchen to show Ethel her new \"polyscience smoking gun\".  You just know there's a disaster in the making! LoL.",

      "content": "Hi, I live in a vegan household and would like to try to make the soft buns you refer to here. The Momofuku recipe I found on Food 52contains 3 tablespoons of nonfat dry milk powder. Do you have thoughts as to what a vegan replacement is for this? I'm not sure what its purpose is in the recipe. See this for discussion: https://www.livestrong.com/article/208885-vegan-substitutes-for-powdered-milk/",
