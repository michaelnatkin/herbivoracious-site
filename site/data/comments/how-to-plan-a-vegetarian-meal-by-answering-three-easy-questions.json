Since we get a CSA share, my \"what's fresh\" criteria is more based on \"what's in the fridge.\"\n\nThe main reason I start by choosing the starch is because it usually takes the longest to cook. Kara has a point, but I try to integrate my protein option with the \"food culture\" choice. Asian dishes are more likely to include tofu, Mexican dishes often have beans, etc.",

      "content": "I find the protein issue very strange, I think that culturally some people tend to think much more about proteins than others, and certainly more than me. Some vegetarian beliefs say that you should have protein at every meal, like rice and lentils, pasta and beans and so on.\n\nI react to this the same way as a I react to the person who tells me that he/she cannot function unless they have a stake a day.\n\nDo you really believe that you need plenty of protein every day?\n\nI remembered being told off mostly by vegetarians for my meals than by non vegetarians.\n(For example, British vegetarians eating baked beans on toast and telling me that they were having a balanced meal, while my salad wasn't complete.) But I stuck with my principles based mostly on quality and fresh rather than quantity and nutritional value, and it has been over twenty years now, with small amount of food and even smaller amounts of proteins. I survived.\n\nI learned that I need concentrated proteins (nuts, beans, dairy) in small quantity few times per week, not daily. And proteins are everywhere, not just in tofu, lentils and so on. They are in pasta, in fruit, in vegetables...If your body is healthy it will absorb proteins from most food.\n\nThe very important thing to me is, and not just for vegetarians and vegans but for everyone, variety. Variety, variety and more variety!\nTeach your body variety and it will respond.\n\nBut this is just me :-), maybe someone does need a slice of tempeh a day to survive...",

Then, if you don't want to make two sep. meats every night, you have to get original and try to make it meatless but satisfying to the meateater. That gets to be challenging. Maybe an idea for your next post :)",

      "content": "Hey Allison - your comment brought a smile to my face because wheat berries were focus of one of my worst early experiments in cooking, 25 years ago. I&#39;d tell you what was in that dish but then I&#39;d have to hide under a rock for the rest of my life, it is that embarrassing. I think the key thing is to get the texture right. It really depends how old they are, you need to keep checking to make sure that they are tender but not complete mush. They are extremely hearty and a little will go a long way. My first inclinations would be to either emphasize that heartiness by pairing them with something like cabbage or beet borscht or roasted mushrooms, or to try to lighten them into a salad with a nice vinaigrette and plenty of fresh veg.",

Every night I stand in my kitchen and think \"pasta, rice or potatoes?\" (I guess going for starch, rather than just a grain), and then work in the protein and veggies based on the cuisine I feel like. So interesting to see my thought process spelled out by someone else! Well done.",

      "content": "My own version opf menu-planning is slightly inverted from yours: I start with the cuisine I\u2019m longing for, and then assemble a meal in that style. Last night it was Indian\u2026so I made an okra/tomato curry, and a dal-chicken-other-veggies curry. And some rice to serve them over, because both are a little more liquid than they could be. The balance of ingredients sort of works itself out, I find\u2026but that\u2019s because I\u2019ve been cooking for a while. The temptation to make, say, a squash curry, that okra/tomato curry, and an eggplant curry, and find oneself without any protein or basic starch\u2026that\u2019s bad.  But it\u2019s not the route I usually find myself following.\n\nI was interested to see your planning refer to the weather. As I do my week's menu planning, one of the first things I check is the weather forecast. If Tuesday's going to be one of those odd summer days where there's a chilly fog all day, I might make a mediterranean fish stew with aioli rather than the Potage St. Germain.  If it's gonna be stinking hot, gazpacho starts to sound really nice, etc.",

I think these are great questions which deserve their whole own post. Soon. Thanks for your comments!",

Here&#39;s to discipline. Although my short-range approach does allow me to fine-tune to the actual weather. I don&#39;t think starting with the cuisine/culture is an inversion; although I might not have made it clear enough, I start with any of the three questions probably with equal frequency and see where it leads me with regard to the other two.",

Not only, where are these kids getting their protein, but also where are they getting their iron.  Iron (from my little knowledge) is not readily absorbed when derived from not meat sources.
