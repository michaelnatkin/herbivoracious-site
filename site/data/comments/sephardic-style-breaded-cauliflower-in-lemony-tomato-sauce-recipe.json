Your recipe for Syrian Lentil soup turned me on to the \"Aromas of Aleppo book\" that you mentioned in that recipe's post - a beautiful cookbook! And as for the lentil soup, it has become an easy and healthy staple in my kitchen.\nCan't wait to try this one! Cheers!",

I had to compete for her attention. )\nI always thought tomato sauce and mayo ruin the taste of any dish. It definitely doesn\u2019t look like that here. OK, Michael with your help I\u2019ll try to take tomato sauce on bail )",

If you haven&#39;t seen Poopa Dweck&#39;s book, Aromas of Aleppo (<a href=\"http://amzn.to/hq9s5u)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://amzn.to/hq9s5u)</a> you should check it out - the Syrian Jewish style is very similar and the photos alone will make you drool.
