      "content": "Sounds REALLY good. I hate to admit I don't know what Carpaccio actually is, so this will be a fun adventure and definitely put a dent in my zucchini crop.\n\nHow crucial to the finished taste/texture is the Parmesan cheese? (As a vegan, I often just leave cheese out, if it's just intended as a \"topping\" but if it's crucial to the construction and finished product then I might need to get creative...) Excited to try it!!",

      "content": "Carpaccio just means &quot;sliced really thin&quot;... it is typically made with meat, but can be applied to vegetables as well. The parm is definitely nice, but it would be a good vegan dish too. Maybe add back Bertolli&#39;s toasted pine nuts for an additional layer of flavor?<br />\n\n<br />",

      "content": "Carpaccio has come to mean anything thinly sliced, but I believe the original meat dish was named for a painter famous for his use of red tones.  Carpaccio might be a more appropriate name for a salad of thinly sliced beets.  In any case, this looks delicious.  I do something very similar, except I salt the thinly sliced zucchini and allow that to sit until the zucchini becomes tender - a slightly different texture, but similar flavors otherwise.",

      "content": "Carpaccio means thin, but also means raw...every dish I called carpaccio is not cooked. But of course today names have different meaning to different people and I must adjust (although for Italians is so hard to adjust sometimes :-)).\n\nI would do this carpaccio raw. You can! cut the zucchini even thinner, add salt and let them throw out the water. rinse, pat dry. add again a little salt, lemon juice and olive oil. Wait 30 minutes. Arrange on a plate and add the other things (parmesan, herbs...).\n\nIf there is some extra juice made by the zucchini marinating you can drizzle it on top.\n\nServe.",
