And I discovered, 3/4 of the way through cooking, that I didn't actually have that leftover red wine that I THOUGHT I had. Solution: replace the wine with a semi-dark beer. Turned out wonderful. If I were to make another change, it'd be to about double the shallots -- they were good, but there were too few to balance the potatoes. Of course, I didn't actually measure anything, so maybe I had too many potatoes to start with. :)",
