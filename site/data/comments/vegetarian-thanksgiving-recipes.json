      "content": "Thanks for these tips for vegetarian Thanksgiving entr\u00e9es.  One of my favorites, for Thanksgiving & Christmas, is cabbage stuffed with a rice-and-chickpeas mixture, which I've adapted from a recipe in Claudia Roden's classic \"New Book of Middle Eastern Food.\"  And, like the best Thanksgiving food out there, it tastes even better reheated the next day!",
