      "content": "I JUST bought some at Whole Foods and I trembled as I picked each one out. At $30 a lb. I picked out my measly little pile...I was shedding a tear while doing so because my parents live in Guatemala and there, when in season, you can literally buy them on any street corner.  I emailed my mom that I had just paid $30 for them and she almost fainted!",

Selfishly, I always buy them for myself, so perhaps the holiday, I should be a bit more giving and let all my friends and family indulge.",

I can many cases to use year round and share a lot with my friends. I feel sorry for those of you that have to pay high prices, as they are readily available to me, at this time each year, if you know what you are doing and where to find them.They are one of my favorites, and love researching new ways to use them. Nice site, saved tis to favorites.",
