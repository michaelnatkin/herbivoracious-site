I'm impressed that you come home and actually have the energy to cook, let alone clean. I learned some tricks from you.\n\nP.S. The only thing you missed was the mopping of the floor. My mom would be on your case about that.",

      "content": "Here's another thing I was thinking about recently. You'd have to adjust it to your own kitchen layout. When I unload my dishwasher, as I take things out I put away only the stuff that is in immediate reach without walking anywhere. The rest I stack on the counter in groups of where it needs to go, and put all of it away last. I also never close any drawers or cabinets that I open during the project, because inevitably there will be one more item  that goes in them. So the very last thing I do is walk through and close everything. Those two tips together save a ton of steps and let me unload a full load in about 2-3 minutes.",
