      "content": "I made this for dinner tonight. I really like the texture and the 'fried potato' taste that results from this treatment. Excellent with a clove of garlic sauteed before adding the gnocchi. Also, I made it with store bought gnocchi. I know it's not as good, but with a salad it makes for an ultra quick weeknight meal that's relatively healthful and fresh tasting.",
