      "content": "Microwaves are awesome, if used for the right things. They work by vibrating water molecules in your food. So for situations where you want to quickly soften something like the bok choy in this dish, or melt chocolate or butter, they are great. Like any other tool, it is all about how you use it.

      "content": "I like the idea of doing it with rice if you can't get the maitake. A bit of a different dish but I think it would be delicious. You could even grill the king oysters to get some char and add more flavor.",

And with mushrooms - divine!  Even Tetsuya, one of Australia's leading chefs, makes a tea broth that has chopped tomatoes warmed in black tea then strained and used as a broth base for fish.\n\nThanks for the great recipe.",
