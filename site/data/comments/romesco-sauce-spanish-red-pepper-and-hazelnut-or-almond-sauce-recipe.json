      "content": "The distinctive flavour of Romesco sauce comes from the flesh of (hydrated) dried \u00abnyora\u00bb peppers. A regular red bell pepper is definitely not the same, but I guess it's as close as you can get since you can't find \u00abnyora\u00bb peppers in the US.\n\nBtw, this post if very timely, Romesco sauce is best eaten with \u00abcal\u00e7ot\u00bb onions during \u00abcal\u00e7otades\u00bb (a popular gastronomical event), and the season just started last week! Unfortunately \u00abcal\u00e7ots\u00bb aren't available in the US either, and they are even harder to substitute than \u00abnyora\u00bb peppers.\n\nAnd Spanish sauce? I think you meant Catalan. :)",
