I also threw in cabbage and cooked kabocha. Didn't have kochujang, so used miso and habanero, which worked fine. I'd double all the seasonings next time (except the habanero, that was perfect).\n\nIf you use fresh noodles as I did, you need to have everything go in at once, by the way, since they take less than 5 minutes to cook.",

      "content": "Excellent. I used generic supermarket mushrooms because in RI, supermarkets don't have fresh Shiitakes, and half a regular eggplant, plus about 1/3lb of Kabocha squash left over from one of Michael's other recent recipes, and multiplied everything 1.5x.  Everyone loved the stew, but also said \"you could go with half as many rice-cakes and twice as much veggie.\" I also recommend serving this in a shallow bowl, because the rice-cakes tend to sink, and that means that in a deep bowl, you eat veggies for a while, and then LOTS of rice for a while, which isn't ideal. The only other thing I'd do to simplify is go ahead and add all the items in step 1 to the water when you first put it on the stove -- no need to wait for it to boil, and it's easier to add stuff to a cool pot than a steaming one. And if you do a 1.5x recipe, you're gonna either need a HUGE skillet or do what I did and use a 3qt saucepan.",

I went with the ovals.

Dunno if that'd work with the frozen ones, though.",

But every single commercially available brand of tteokbokki I've ever come across lists wheat as the first ingredient.  They're more like \"rice cakes\" rather than actual rice cakes.  And with so many sources of potential gluten, it's almost outright deceptive to call this recipe gluten free.",

Anyhow, I'll update the recipe to mention that you should look at the tteok too.",

      "content": "Continuing the Gluten Free theme. I love kochujang and the dishes it enables but it never dawned on me that it might not be gluten free (my fiancee eats gluten free). Buying in an Asian grocery recently, where their options all had a clear set of ingredients in English, I was surprised to see that wheat flour was a prominent ingredient. Is there a brand that uses a gluten free flour in their formulation (rice flour, perhaps?) that I could look for? If not, Michael might have made the same assumption I did and perhaps this dish should not be flagged gluten free? \nWould love to find a gluten free kochujang option if anyone knows of one!",
