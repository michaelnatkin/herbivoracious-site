      "content": "This sounds great. I'll have to give this a try. We've been celebrating Shabbat too pretty regularly this past year and I've been baking challahs on Friday (the recipe I use makes two loaves) but I almost always forget to make our Friday night dinner go well with the challah. You would think I'd be better about this because it *is* a thing I do weekly!...but somehow I'm not... maybe it's because we all relish the French toast we have every Saturday morning (and I freeze all the French toast leftovers and my 7 and 4 year old eat it for breakfast during the week before school).... so all is not wasted!",
