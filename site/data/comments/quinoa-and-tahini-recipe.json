      "content": "I lived for two years in a vegetarian consensus-run cooperative house that by anyone's account was thoroughly hippie. And yes, I agree, that's hippie food. Also in that genre: a random stir-fry of veggies and spices served over a random grain, assuming the lack of cultural similarity still holds. Amazing how hearty and delicious that can be.\n\nMy only quibble would be that I've never rinsed my quinoa before cooking. Seems like too much extra work for no reason; the quinoa never tastes bitter at all. Not worth it, in my opinion.",

      "content": "Alana - sounds like we lived in the same co-op :). I think the deal with the quinoa is that some producers pre-rinse and others don&#39;t, at least that is what I gather from Wikipedia. So depending on what you&#39;ve got, it might not be necessary. I find it only take a minute - I certainly don&#39;t do any multi-hour soak like some people say.<br />",

      "content": "I cooked this tonight for dinner and it was delicious! I substituted gold potatoes (boiled) for tofu and sauteed the green beans in olive oil with salt + pepper. Between the salt in the tahini mixture and my addition, I found I overdid it. I probably added almost a cup of water to the tahini mixture to get the right consistency, but make sure you add it small increments. I also used three garlic cloves instead of one, and found that it could've used more lemon (I only had a small one on hand). I garnished with aleppo. \n\nenjoy! and thank you, Michael!",
