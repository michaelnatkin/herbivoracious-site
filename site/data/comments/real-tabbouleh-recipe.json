I took my fork and lifted it up to see where the Bulgar was -- she was so confused! There, it's just a chopped herb salad eaten with pita. What culture does the bulgar aspect come from?",

Everywhere that I&#39;m familiar with in the Middle East, it definitely is a salad of green, but it does have about, oh, maybe 20% bulghur by volume.

I simply rinse it under cold water in a colander and then let it dry on some paper towel.  I will try your method next time I make tabbouleh.  Thanks for the tip :D",
