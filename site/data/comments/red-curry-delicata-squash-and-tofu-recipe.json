My eyes burned from inadvertently moving my head over the steam too.  So wish i would have known they were hot peppers and not sweet peppers. Lol\n\nI can't get lemon grass where i live now. Would it still taste ok without? I was thinking of using fresh basil instead.",

AND you give another recipe to use with my leftover paste (although I'd gladly just make it again. The little delicata moons, which I'd never had before, were luscious!) Thanks so much for your blog!",

      "content": "Just made this, and, as sometimes happens, I was unable to get all the right ingredients. No delicata available so I used one acorn squash and one small butternut; I was only able to get arbol chiles, so I used six, but I discarded the seeds of four of them since they are hotter, and we could still discern all the flavors in the curry. We all loved it. When delicata turns up in the store I will definitely make it again.",
