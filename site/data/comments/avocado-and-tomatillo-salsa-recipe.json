I've been a silent observer of the blog for a few months, but have been keeping up with all your cool news - and I *finally* just ordered your book. Loved the chaat post (rice crackers! brilliance!)",

It's also great with a poblano tossed into the mix.\n\nI don't usually use garlic though.  I'll have to try that next time!",
