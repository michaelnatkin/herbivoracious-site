      "content": "Ohhhh I am so jealous.\n\nHowever, I have a date (with my mom!) at <a href=\"http://www.dirtcandynyc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dirt Candy</a> in a few weeks, and they do a very similar stone-ground grits dish (Stone Ground Grits, pickled shitakes and a tempura poached egg) that is supposedly amazing.\n\nAnd don't you find it overwhelming when you have the <b>entire</b> menu to choose from?  I've been a vegetarian since birth so I'm completely accustomed to having only 1 or 2 (or commonly in the past, no) choices; when I go to vegetarian restaurants, my head spins!",
