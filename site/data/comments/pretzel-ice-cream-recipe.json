      "content": "I inadvertently came upon the pretzel/ice cream combination myself a few weeks ago. We were on a long drive, and after a bathroom break at a gas station, bought our daughters a bag of butter flavored pretzels, and a pint of vanilla ice cream to be shared. Curious, my husband added a pretzel to his ice cream. It was really, really good. The fake butter flavor really was excellent with the vanilla as well. I suppose maybe the caramel would be the natural analogue to that.",
