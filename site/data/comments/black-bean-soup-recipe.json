Used a large hypodermic (perhaps for cattle injections? I use them for epoxy!) ca. 1\" diam, to spread the sour cream, which was very pretty. I *did* manage to foget the oranges, which would have been good, but it was still great without them. Even though the salsa is hot, overall the soup-plus-salsa was quite mild.",

Also, I really love cilantro and would use it so often if only it was easy to find (in Italy it's not common at all and almost nobody uses it...I used to plant it and have it during the summer months but it has a really short life cicle every time... I'll try again this spring to enjoy it in the summer).",

I know your picture is color corrected but I did not get even the same consistency or hue. Not only that but there was no flavor. I had to add a million and one different spices just to get some flavor. I don't think the yellow pepper did anything for the taste either. I have tried a great deal of black bean soup recipes and I was so sad that this didn't do anything for me. High hopes = busted. Thank you for posting it though, I am still on my quest. I may just have to make up my own to satisfy my taste buds.",
