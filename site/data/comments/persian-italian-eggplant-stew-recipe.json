      "content": "Interesting use of mosto cotto. Just like to add, it takes a bit more than ageing to make mosto cotto into balsamic. (You need the fermentation and acetic bio- oxidation - turning the must into vinegar) before the ageing. Sorry for sounding so dotty, and please indulge me Michael, the fact is that I am from Modena.... :-) ;-)",

      "content": "Some people do, Saba is mosto cotto, grape must cooked for a few hours in a copper pot (with some whole walnuts inside - usually 12, don't know why, so that it doesn't stick to the bottom) it becomes very sweet and it is bottled as saba or sapa. To make balsamic vinegar you also cook must, in bigger pots, for about 11 hours, without walnuts :-)\n\nI mean, there are many types of mosto cotto, and some is called saba.\n\nFYI, Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena is made only with cooked must, while Aceto Balsamico di Modena (without the word tradizionale) is made with cooked must and wine vinegar.",

      "content": "You may find it interesting to know that we Persians have another dish (called khoresht-e-bademjan or eggplant stew) which is basically eggplant cooked with some meat and tomatoes, and in that we put something we call \"ghooreh\" which is green (as in not ripe) grapes or the cooked juice of that \"ab-ghooreh\". Ghooreh is sour and I've never tried mosto cotto, but maybe it is similar to ab-ghooreh. Ab-ghooreh is also the perfect salad dressing in my opinion.",

Sounds more similar to verjus (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verjuice)\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verjuice)</a> than mosto cotto. We are lucky enough to live in an area where it shouldn&#39;t be hard to get unripe grapes, so I&#39;ll have to try making that myself (both cooked and uncooked).\n\nThanks,\nMichael",

I have prepared eggplant in both ways and with my experience I have found that when you salt, rinse and dry the eggplant they roast/brown really well and keep their form ie don't become mushy. The salt brings out excess water moisture and the key is to rinse and pat dry before cooking. \n\nI look forward to eating this. It sounds delicious",
