      "content": "I've got to try this one. Our CSA got me cooking a LOT of chard early last summer, and I was longing for new recipes. The one thing I might do differently is to toss in the chopped stems first, and add the leaves only for the last bit of the cooking (the last 1-2 min, maybe?). That way it requires a little less babysitting, and you can adjust how wilted you want the leaves.",
