Your blog looks great and I think it will be very helpful in my quest to find recipes to please my family, who are less than thrilled by the change.\n\nI bake a challah every week and my kids love french toast made from it.

My family vacations in Colorado sometimes, and there is this amazing tiny little bakery in the town we go to that makes the absolute best challah. I wake up at night dreaming of it sometimes (ha).",
