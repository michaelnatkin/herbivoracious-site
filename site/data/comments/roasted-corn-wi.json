      "content": "Thanks everybody! Nate, good question. You could generally use this anywhere a southwestern flavor and a little fat would be appropriate. I'd generally use it to finish a dish, not saute in it. Some ideas:\n\n- corn off the cob saute with onions and peppers\n- on top of an omelette with southwestern or mexican fillings\n- on toasted bread as the beginning of a sandwich, instead of mayo\n- i wonder how it would be as the basis of a beurre blanc (obviously not blanc, white)\n- on just about anything coming off the grill, veggie or not",
