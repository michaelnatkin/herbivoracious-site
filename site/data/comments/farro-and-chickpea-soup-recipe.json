      "content": "Hey Sabrina - farro has somewhat of a nutty, wheaty flavor. It is an ancient grain closely related to wheat. Stores like Whole Foods will have it but probably not an average grocery. You can also order it online; there is a link in the article.",

      "content": "Hi Kate - \n\nThat's a fair request, but I don't have a bunch in my house right now to weigh for you. The good news is, this isn't the kind of recipe that requires great precision to be delicious, so I think if you just use the rubber-banded bunch you bought, you should be just fine. Let me know how you like it!",

      "content": "Michael,\n\nThanks for the reply. I ended up using half the bunch but probably could have used more. And I messed up a few times along the way but, you're right, it was delicious regardless. Oh, and I added sauteed sliced button mushrooms because I have a thing for mushrooms in soup. Anyway, thanks for such a fabulous recipe! It's going on the regular winter soup rounds. :)",

      "content": "I'm not a farro fan, but I like this recipe.  You cook the farro for longer than I've read elsewhere (15-30 mins. is what I've read, you did 50 mins.).  Any reason?  Also, I didn't have mustard greens, so used Lacinto kale; and cannelini for chick peas. Going for the Italian feel.  Also added a little cabbage, shallots.  Perfect December dinner soup. Thanks for posting.",

      "content": "Well, two things about the cooking time for farro: (1) it can vary a lot depending on whether it is whole grain or semi-pearled, and (2) I like it as tender as I can get it. I'm just not a big fan of really chewy grains. My personal take I guess. Your choices for the greens and beans sounds great!",
