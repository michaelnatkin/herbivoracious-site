I never heard of that. Now I just have to figure out if there is a vegetarian equivalent. Maybe agar can do it?\n\nGarrett - Looking forward to your results on PH compensation, that will be good to know.\n\nMichelle - I agree with the results, but not the conclusion you draw from them!\n\nAnd Ben - I think you are going to blow your guests away with that!",
