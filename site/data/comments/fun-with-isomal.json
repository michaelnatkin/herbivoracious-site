      "content": "isomalt is used a lot in the pastry kitchen because it's less hygroscopic (water-absorbing) than ordinary table sugar. Albert Adria uses this property to make \"hummingbirds\" with heads made out of liquid-filled isomalt.\n\ntry putting a ring mold down on a silpat, then pouring a little isomalt caramel inside. once it's cooled slightly, you can slowly pull the ring mold up, making a conical bell of isomalt. or, before pulling it up, put a little something (e.g., a hazelnut) on top of the caramel to encase it in the sugar.",

      "content": "I like the ideas here...something else to try when using isomalt.  Heat oven to 300 F.  Using a silicone mat on a sheet tray sprinkle isomalt in any pattern you want.  Then sprinkle your food coloring.  The Isomalt will not melt where you have coloring giving you a very cool design.  When it comes out of the oven, let cool for about 2 min till it starts to harden then use your silicone mat and shape it into a very cool table certerpiece that.",
