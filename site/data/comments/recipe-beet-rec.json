      "content": "Hi Lisa - that cherry vinegar was an import that I got from ChefShop.com. Not sure if they still carry it. It didn&#39;t have a nutrition label on it, so I can&#39;t tell you exactly how much sugar, but it was moderately sweet, like a good balsamic - which would also be good in this dish.",
