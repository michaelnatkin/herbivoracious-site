You probably won&#39;t want to use the whole head, napa &quot;melts&quot; quite a bit, like spinach. Should be delicious though! Let me know how it comes out.",

One of my local groceries carries it, but you can find it online too. It sounds like it would be perfect for this dish.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Matouks-Pepper-Sauce-Salsa-Picante/dp/B0038MFOUI\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Matouks-Pepper-Sauce-Salsa-Picante/dp/B0038MFOUI</a> All of the Matouk's sauces are good and add a hot, sweet, vinegar-y kick. Yum.\n\nBruce",
