      "content": "Glad you got to Kisaku! This is our top restaurant for sushi in Seattle. Nishino is good, but I find it too pretentious, and the food too \"fusioned\" (designed for the Madison Park crowd?). I'm pretty connected to the Japanese community and Kisaku is consistently the favorite. I can tell you that the fish has always been fabulous, and Nakano-san's preparations like hotate konbu jime (kelp-marinated scallop) are quite special.",
