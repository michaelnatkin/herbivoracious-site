      "content": "Cool! Might you freeze the two together briefly? Would it make the cherry tomato go all mealy if you only did it for a minute. If you were going to go all Keller on it, you'd stuff them with fois gras. But that would be a tad much. I have both cherry tomatoes (volunteers from last year, yea!) and huge cherries from the market right now....(insert the the patter patter patter sound of me going to my kitchen)",

      "content": "I like the idea of stuffing them as a non-molecular way of attaching them; with flavored cream cheese, maybe?  Martha Stewart has a phenomenal recipe for pistachio-dusted roquefort grapes in her hors d'oeuvres book (under \"classics\"-- all classics for a VERY good reason-- they look boring but they're all revelatory; I served the grapes at my wedding and people went nuts) and taking a cue from that recipe could be a way to go.  (adds fat &amp; crunch, which this cherry/cherry combo looks like it still needs.\n\nBut it's such a fun idea-- 75% there-- keep going with it!  I'm waiting for your next book, Michael, which I hope will be on eccentric, fancy, occasionally el bulli-inspired amuses bouches and party food!  just putting that out there.  :)",
