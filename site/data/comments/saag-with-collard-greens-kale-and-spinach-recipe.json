      "content": "One of the reasons I have fallen a little bit in love with my pressure cooker is it's ability to tenderize tough greens like kale and collards.  What I generally do is wilt the greens with a little bit of oil in the bottom of the open PC after stripping, washing and chopping.  Once wilted I add just enough liquid to cover and pressure cook for about 15 minutes.  The formerly tough leaves become as tender as if they had simmered all day.  In making saag dishes, I usually do this and then add the cooked greens to the fried spice mixture and simmer them together for a short time to marry the flaovors.",

      "content": "Oh, thanks for the recipe. And big thanks for the tips: not to bring to a boil a cream. I think that was my mistake before. I've try saag paneer once that was prepared by one of my friend's mother. It was delicious! Really, not to heavy, perfect balance of spices. Then I ordered a few times in indian restaurants, and you are right, it's too heavy and reach. I will definitely make this one soon. Thanks again for the recipe and all the tips!",

      "content": "I wanted to commend you on your light version of this saag dish that calls for yogurt.  I also wanted to give a shout-out to your reader Dave who's comments I wish to echo concerning the pressure cooker.  \n\nHere's a variation from my kitchen:  two bags of chopped frozen spinach, once cube of frozen methi (fenugreek), one large red onion, one can of petite diced tomatoes, a half cup of water to be pressure-cooked for 15 minutes.  Let pressure cool down; open lid, and use a hand blender directly in the cooker to partially puree.  Make your 'tadka' seasoning like this:  in four tbps. EVOO add hing, 1 tbsp. garlic paste, a half-pack of ready-made MTR's palak-paneer masala.  When the seasoning is well-tempered, add it to the pressure-cooker, stir well, simmer for five and let stand for a few minutes.  I completely forgo all dairy, but do add a big tbsp. of desi ghee at the very end before wrapping it up!\n\nServe w/ roti or chawal!",
