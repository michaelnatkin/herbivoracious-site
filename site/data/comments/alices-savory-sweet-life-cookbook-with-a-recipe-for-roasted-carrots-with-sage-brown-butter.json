      "content": "Nothing too specific, but clearly the sweeter the carrot you start with, the sweeter the ultimate result will be. I would probably tend to use farmer's market or organic carrots that are medium sized - not so small that they won't have enough interior, nor so big that they are likely to be bland and woody.",
