      "content": "Some of the gluten-free pastas are, in fact, quite good.  (I'm fine with gluten; my husband doesn't have celiac-sprue but for some other reason has trouble digesting most commercial wheat-based pasta - but the gluten free brands we've tried give him infinitely less trouble).\nDeBoles makes a very nice one; Heartland (found at WalMart) is also good.  The brown-rice elbow macaroni from WinCo Foods (PacNW only) is perfectly acceptable, altho I prefer the DeBoles.  Haven't tried Tinkyada yet; it's not available where I normally shop.  If you ned to eat GF pasta, it pays to try as many different brands as possible (and different shapes within the brands - it makes a difference) as there is wider variation, I think, than between semolina-based pastas.\nAnd I love eggplant with pasta.",
