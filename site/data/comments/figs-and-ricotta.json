      "content": "Ricotta *is* fairly popular, but sadly the US national brands are just terrible. Grainy and lacking the clean dairy sweetness they should have. I guess they are sort of passable for cooking, but anything where you would eat them fresh is a travesty. Calabro is great; if you can&#39;t find that or a good local variety, your best bet is to make your own from really good milk. (Which is super easy to do).",
