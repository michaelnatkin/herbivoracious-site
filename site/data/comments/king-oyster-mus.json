      "content": "We recently cooked with king oyster mushrooms and I was pleasantly surprised at the flavour and texture. I've had oyster mushrooms and thought the king would be about the same. We cooked it in a Thai basil stirfry with chicken -- and it had a similar texture to chicken! In fact, I found I quite preferred it to the chicken!\n\nLovely ingredient and I would love it with grilled polenta and pesto. Thanks for sharing.",

      "content": "Mushrooms only $19.99? Bargain! I once saw chanterelles at Whole Wallet for only $39.99.\nLucky me, going to the Bavarian Alps in July where you can get a whole basket for five Euros.\nWhen I lived in Boston Costco briefly carried chanterelles from Canada at an acceptable price - look for them in the Fall. A delight, even when they' don't look perfect.",
