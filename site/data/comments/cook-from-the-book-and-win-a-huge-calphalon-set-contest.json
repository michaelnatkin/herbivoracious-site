I just did the delicious Savoury Bread Pudding with Morels and took great photos, but I just checked the book and it doesn't seem to be in it! :( I don't supposed an exception could be made? \n\nAnyway, it's a really great book. I'm going to have a fun year doing as many of the recipes as possible.",

      "content": "I got your cookbook last week, and so far, everything is really delicious.  You seem to get a lot of umami from vegetables.  I loved the chili that I made today, so I'll probably enter the contest with that.  The Szechuan dish was really good.  However, I have been to 5 Oriental grocery stores, and I haven't found the Szechuan vegies.  Could you specifiy a brand or a store where I can find them?  Even Uwajimaya didn't seem to have them.  Other than that, it's been fun to cook from a vegetarian cookbook that strives for good flavor.  Keep up the good work.",

      "content": "Hey Gail - this contest is already over; sorry about that. I'm almost positive that Uwajimaya has the Szechwan Preserved Vegetable because that is where I end up shopping for my Asian groceries 90% of the time. Here's an Amazon link you could order it from, but it also shows you what the can looks like (not usually in German, but the colors are right) which might make it easier to spot if the employees can't find it for you: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00523N2QE/?tag=poeticlicen07-20 . I'm so glad you are enjoying the cookbook and please let me know if any other questions come up.\n\nThanks,\nMichael",
