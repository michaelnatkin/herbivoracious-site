I have friends that toss them over salad but I have never been on board with this practice, so when my when my friend found this recipe and suggested I use it for a dinner party last week I was hesitant to say the least. But I decided to indulge her and was pleasantly surprised. They were delicious! I am definitely adding this to my book of <a href=\"http://appetizer.betterrecipes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Appetizer Recipes</a>. I work with Better Recipes but I had yet to come across a recipe like this. I have been recommending it all my other anti-chickpea friends and trying to convert them as well!",

I think that panko would serve that same function of absorbing moisture and adding a bit of fluffiness, but I&#39;m not completely sure. If you try it, let us know how it turns out!\n\n\nThanks,\nMichael",
