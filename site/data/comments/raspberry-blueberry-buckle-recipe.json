      "content": "Hi, Michael,\n\nMy name is Patrick from Taiwan, and I am running a vegetarian website, VegTomato, <a href=\"http://www.vegtomato.org/,\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vegtomato.org/,</a> to advocate vegetarianism among Chinese community with some friends, and all of us are volunteers. VegTomato is a non-profit and non-commercial website, and all of us are volunteers, which was launched in May 2004.\nJust found your great blog with so many inspiring and useful information and recipes, I am wondering if I can have your permission to translate some of the entries into Chinese and use them in our website? I will link back and credit it to you.\n\nThanks for your time to read this mail and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nPatrick Shih\nVegtomato\n<a href=\"http://www.vegtomato.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.vegtomato.org/</a>",
