I don&#39;t think I&#39;d so much increase the pasta as just count on the overall dish serving fewer people. Something about the stringozzi, possibly because it is so thick, just seems to be extra filling, but in a good way. I ate the leftover noodles last night as sort of an impromptu carbonara and it was insane.",

Even within a few Kilometers they're a bit confused! Anyway, it's because of all the different dialects even within only one region.\nIn my area, there's a similar kind of pasta, it's just shorter, and we call it 'strozzapreti'. Just imeagine how many different names for slightly different kinds of pasta you can find in traditional Italian cooking (plus all the new names introduced by the big names like Barilla)!",
