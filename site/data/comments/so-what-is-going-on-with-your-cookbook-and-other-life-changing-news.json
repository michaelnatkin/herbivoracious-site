My husband has 17 months left of his medical residency training, after which we are going back home, to Seattle. So I am really looking forward to eat at your restaurant. We live in a meat \"country\" on the Oklahoma/Arkansas border at this time, and only here we ... converted to a vegetarians. Transition was easy, I just quit eating meat \"cold turkey'. The challenging part was to find natural and organic produce (non-GMO, no pesticides, etc...). And while other people here hunt for a game, I \"hunt\" for organic potatoes, non-GMO tofu, and all other stuff. It would be a very happy moment one day to say -  for \"What's for dinner?\" -\" Let's go to Michael's restaurant!\"  Good luck and all the best wishes to you and your family!",

I'm sold.\n\nOne technical question though: For measured items -- especially things like flour and salt that can vary by volume more than, say, water -- do you do the units as cups, Tbsp, etc or grams? One thing I wish more cookbooks would do is use weight instead of volume since things like \"1 cup of flour\" or \"1 Tbsp salt\" aren't precise (which is especially important in baking).\n\nJust curious why you did or didn't use precise measurements.",

      "content": "Hey Ben - It is a very good, very fair question which I gave a lot of thought to. Here's where I landed. For technically precise savory recipes, like those associated with the modernist movement, there is absolutely a need for precision. While I love those kinds of recipes, this isn't that kind of book so I didn't think I needed them there. \"1/2 cup finely diced onions\" is going to be close enough, especially when you consider that every onion tastes different anyhow. For baking, I agree with you 100%. However really the precision there is mainly with regard to flour, as things like sugar don't vary much. All of my testing is done with 1 cup of flour equal to 4.5 ounces (128 grams), and I certainly encourage you to weigh that. It is also quite useful to weigh baking soda, etc but I don't think too many people have scales with sub-gram accuracy, so the traditional teaspoons etc work well enough. And then there is salt, which is tricky because the different flakes sizes really do weigh quite different amounts in the same volume, but again requires quite a good scale - 1 gram accuracy doesn't do it, so I've done all of the bulk salting using Diamond Crystal kosher salt for consistency. Bottom line, I figured that cooking by weight just hasn't caught on that much in the US yet, so I stuck with standard conventions to keep it accessible, but I'm happy to help anyone who has questions about making a recipe more precise.",

Just like my Moosewood cookbooks from the '90s, many of your recipes have become standby favorites in my house: the Swiss chard and onion enchiladas, the spinach and mushroom lasagna (and like most people I'm a lasagna snob), potstickers (gyoza), vegetarian Indian tacos, chana masala, and O, holy fungi, the shiitake and morel ravioli in brodo. I love your stories of food, from your cast iron skillet to guacamole. I really appreciate how your recipes and philosophy are not \"let's take the meat out and fill that hole\" but \"let's start from the ingredients and build good food.\" The food is important, sure, but so is the narrative about that food. I've already pre-ordered your cookbook and I look forward to visiting your restaurant when I come to Seattle - seriously, I would make a special trip. You are stepping out into the unknown, but you are not unprepared and we are with you!",
