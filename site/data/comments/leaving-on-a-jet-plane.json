      "content": "Just found your site.  We've been cooking meat-free for the last 3 months and the recipes from herbivoracious are comprising this week's menu in our home.  We had the polenta with peperonata tonight and loved it, but being a southern gal I love anything that resembles grits.  I wish your book signing were coming to Atlanta.  Does herbivoracious come from \"Dinosaur Train\"?  It's the only other place I have ever heard this term, but being a mom of 4 small children, I don't get out much.  Thanks for the inspiration with my cooking.  I'm looking forward to some good eating!",
