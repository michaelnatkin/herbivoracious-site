      "content": "Interesting topic!  This year, I'm actually attending an omnivorous event and bringing a veg main (I'm leaning toward butternut squash lasagna), and then hosting a veggie event the following day, so I guess I'm pretty firmly in camp 1.  For me, it has to do with the special-ness  of the day-- it really feels like an EVENT if there's an exciting main course.  Add to that my brother's general cluelessness (he's likely to forget and add bacon to several things, for instance, and I can guarantee that there will be a Jello salad) and I will be better off making sure I have my own goodies.  After all, just because I'm a vegetarian doesn't mean I don't want to overeat on Thanksgiving!",

But that's just because omnivores generally have NO clue what vegetarians like to eat!  That and the whole \"chicken and fish are vegetarian\" misconception. Oh, and the \"I'll just add a little chicken broth to her food because without meat she'll DIE!\" and, yeah.  I had Taco Bell on the way, I'm good.  But really, what I wouldn't give to sit down at a table with all of the above spread out before me.  Mmmmm...",
