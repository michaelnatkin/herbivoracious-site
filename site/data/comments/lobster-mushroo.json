I've been complaining to everyone I've met about the fact that vegetarian cooks so often try to replicate meat-based dishes (often unsuccessfully) rather than being creative and making use of all of the wonderful properties of vegetarian ingredients.  I see in your blog the creativity and flavor that I have been craving.  Thank you!!!  Welcome to my blogroll.",
