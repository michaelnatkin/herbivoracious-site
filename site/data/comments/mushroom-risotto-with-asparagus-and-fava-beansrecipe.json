      "content": "Mmm, this looks SO good - the fava beans are a great twist. Do you use normal crimini mushrooms? baby bellas? whatever's in stock? I wonder if something like fresh chanterelles or shiitakes would shine or just get lost in the rice (if you could afford/find them)?",

Btw I am in need of a new pressure cooker and am going to check out the one you linked to - electric seems less scary than the stovetop variety too.",

I'll definitely try it next time with the mushrooms and water cooked with the rice. My \"mantecare\" consists of a healthy addition of gorgonzola cheese and Parmesan, and I tossed in chopped parsley and a thin-sliced spring onion. It's so creamy and earthy and so quick and easy in the pressure cooker.",
