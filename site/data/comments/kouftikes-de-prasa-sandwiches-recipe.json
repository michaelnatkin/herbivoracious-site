It's not hard to have all three of these done in about a half-hour.\n\nBut as Spring approaches, I think that your mango salad, some kind of tofu stir-fry, and baby zucchini/squash sliced lengthwise and fried in olive oil, finished with some lemon juice that can kind of caramelize on them...THAT might move to the head of the list.",
