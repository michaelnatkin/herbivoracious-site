      "content": "I wonder if there's a way you could approach it like masa is made without losing the toasty corn flavor.  They say that processing the corn in an alkaline solution makes it more digestible and therefore more nutritious so it might even have a side benefit.  You could either buy some pickling lime or use wood ashes if you happen to grill over wood to make the solution.  It sounds like a lot of trouble, but it might be the only way to get the smooth texture.\n\nHere are just a few interesting links I found when I Googled \"masa harina\" (and then \"ashes vs lime for treating corn\".  If you decide to try it, I'd love to hear how it goes.\n\nhttp://recipes.howstuffworks.com/what-is-masa-harina.htm\n\nhttp://www.culturesforhealth.com/pickling-lime.html\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixtamalization :\n\nThe ancient Aztec and Mayan civilizations developed nixtamalization using lime (calcium hydroxide, not the citrus fruit of the same name) and ash (potassium hydroxide) to create alkaline solutions. The Chibcha people to the north of the ancient Inca also used calcium hydroxide (also known as \"cal\"), while the tribes of North America used naturally occurring sodium carbonate or ash.",

      "content": "That's a *very* interesting idea. I like it. I know Dave Arnold from Cooking Issues has done some great work on nixtamalization (here's a linK: http://www.cookingissues.com/2011/03/09/mesoamerican-miracle-megapost-tortillas-and-nixtamalization/), maybe I can incorporate that. The flavor would be different but who is to say it might not be even better! Thanks for the suggestion.",

Not quite the desired result. A couple of folks have suggested ways of softening the corn, that is probably the best thing to try if the Champion doesn't solve it.",

I'm thinking it's not terribly nutritious, but sounds quite delicious!",
