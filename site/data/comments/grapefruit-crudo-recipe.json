      "content": "I just made this for a New Year's Eve party. It's simple enough that I was able to bring the ingredients, do the work in a few minutes on a little bit of countertop at the party, and juice the \"waste\" grapefruit into a pitcher for the bar right next to me. I substituted ground white pepper, and I think that it worked a little better than the ground black pepper.\n\nThe response was terrific. People loved this dish. The main reaction was like \"This tastes great, and I never would've though to put these things together!\".\n\nA couple of the grapefruit pieces had some tough membrane, and the people who got these weren't as happy. So, just be careful with your cutting---just like cutting fish, I suppose.",
