The same technique works when you need to make 1/2\"-wide ribbons of omelet to \"weave\"  into a lattice over a recipe like Nasi Goreng: you make a 10\" thin omelet or two, roll it up, and cut into 1/2\" cylinders, and then weave to your heart's content. You get much better results than just trying to cut it straight on the flat.",
