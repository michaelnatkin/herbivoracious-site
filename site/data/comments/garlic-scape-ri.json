      "content": "I recommend the flip method, and pre-cooking any ingredients that need more than a minute or two.  Cheese generally melts well on a flipped pizza because the topped side is toasty hot when the toppings hit it, and the crust retains heat even after it comes off the grill.  Also, if you put the lid down when finishing, it will help the ingredients on top cook a little faster and more evenly because the heat can circulate.",
