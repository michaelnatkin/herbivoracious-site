      "content": "Have you ever baked risotto? This is my new trick. You add the risotto with the stock or wine in a big covered pot in the oven. Then you bake it for 40 minutes until the stock has absorbed into the rice. Then you stir in the cheese, etc. The risotto comes out perfectly ever time.",
