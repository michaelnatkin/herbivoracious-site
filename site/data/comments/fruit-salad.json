      "content": "Hi!\n\nI just happened to have a couple boxes of this very Alpine apple cider mix on hand, so I had to give this salad concept a try.  I forgot the black olives at the market, and as I had just been picking violets in the woods this morning, I added a few of those. I would not have time to locate the isomalt. My other adaptations produced the following:\n\nAvocado/lime square, topped with tangerine and pink grapefruit segments. 4 thin slices of plum. 1 plump fresh blackberry. 3 violet petals, fresh picked garden thyme, two peeled green grapes, one on a pile of Alpine apple cider powder. (I forgot to add the tomato guts) A drizzle of olive/canola oil and sprinkling of sea salt. For the smokey flavor, I ventured a scant dusting of smoked paprika. Interesting, but not recommended.\n\nIf I work this out further, I will add my rendition to my salad blog with pics, at <a href=\"http://www.salad-a-day.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.salad-a-day.com</a>\n\nThanks for the idea and the amazing structure, surprising flavors and textures. So pretty!",
