      "content": "The banchan looks so delicious! :) So cool that you're writing a book!!!\n\nDo you use mung bean sprouts or soy bean sprouts? I was under the impression that it was soy sprouts, but maybe not. I love to add a hint of gochugaru for a spicy kick and color! YUM!",

      "content": "Thanks, Esther! There are banchan made from both of those types of sprouts. I believe the mung bean sprout version is known as sookju namul and the soy bean sprout version is kongnamul muchim - but someone please correct me if that isn&#39;t right... I&#39;m definitely no expert on Korean food, just an appreciating amateur!",

Funny thing is that the main focus in Korean food is meat but to me the side dishes have always been the star in the meal. I am going to try your recipe with a couple of dishes using Kabocha squash and white sweet potato. Toasted sesame oil and gochugang go so well with these two veggies.\nCheers,\nHeguiberto",
