      "content": "Hey Anne - yeah, personally I don't worry about it unless the taste offends\nme. They didn't kill a fish for me to eat, it just incidentally touched the\nsame oil, so I don't stress about it. Actually I think Pike St. might be\nkeeping a separate fryer for vegetable dishes, though I didn't ask... kinda\nlooked that way to me. Anyone in the know? That would be a rare but nice\nlevel of concern!",
