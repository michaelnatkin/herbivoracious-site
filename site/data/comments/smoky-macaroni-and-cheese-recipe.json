I've never tried it with smoked cheese. Ever thought of smoked salt? I make his veggie greens with that and we love it..sans bacon but with same smoky flavor. Thanks for inspiration!",

This recipe was a perfect combination of great taste, very creamy, along with a nice contrast in textures.\n\nI look forward to trying more of Michael's recipe.",

      "content": "Celiac sufferers, you could also make this gluten-free; WinCo (which I think is in Seattle as well as the Portland area) has in their bulk section a gluten-free brown-rice elbow macaroni.  It's pretty tasty - I fed it with a vegetable marinara sauce to my if-there's-no-meat-it's-not-a-meal mother and sister, and they thought it was fine!  (I buy rice pasta because altho my husband does not have celiac sprue - he is just fine eating homemade bread - there is something in commercial pastas that doesn't agree with him.  We haven't figured out what, yet, and probably won't because the ingredients lists look so harmless . . . .)",

      "content": "To convert dried bread into bread crumbs in a food processor you can use the main chopping blade; this will result in a mix of stuff from \"dust\" up to \"about the size of a US dime\", or that's what I found when I did it yesterday. Today, aiming for more uniformity and a larger-than-sand-grains size, I tried using the shredder blade and the top-feeder. The result: breadcrumbs that are each about the size of a small pea -- maybe the size of a lemon-seed or orange-seed. PERFECT for this recipe. Hooray for experimentation! One thing: if your bread isn't completely dry, you'll end up with doughy bits stuck above the shredder blade, heating up because of all the friction, etc. So if you want to use the shredder blade, really dry the bread out.",
