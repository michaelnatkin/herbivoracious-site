I'll give yours a shot!\n\nBTW, I don't usually buy these kinds of convenience foods, but I find prepackaged coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots) to be a big timesaver when I make curtido (or hot and sour soup, for that matter).",

This dish is only Salvadorian.\nYou forgot to include the tomato salsa that goes on top of the curtido. its a very simply salsa not spicy at all. \nPupusas can also be made of rice flour and they can also contain a variety of other stuffings like chicharron (pork), squash blossom, loroco, shrimp, fish, cheese, beans with cheese, revueltas (pork, cheese and beans) depending on the region of El Salvador. \nPupusas are my favorite dish from El Salvador, you will all love them. There are many other great dishes like the Salvadorian tamales wrapped in banana lives made from a tender strained masa very popular in central america. The plantain empanadas stuffed with milk pudding or black beans, stuff meat peppers, turkey sandwich, meat picadillo turnovers, fried plantains, sopa de pata (cow feet soup), yucca with pork, the quesadilla bread, the horchata drink, fruit salad drink",
