      "content": "Have you ever tried cooking artichokes in a broth infused with liquid smoke? It adds a really interesting flavor. I recently did a recipe with a smokey-berbere broth, and it was a really nice break from the more traditional artichoke flavors. I love seeing recipes for anything other than \"steam and serve with butter,\" though, and this one looks fabulous.",
