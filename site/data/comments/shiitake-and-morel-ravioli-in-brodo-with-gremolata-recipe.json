I have tried the dried ones, but they do not compare with the real thing. We pick them, soak them in water, then cut them in half and fry in butter for just 30 seconds. The flavor is unbelievable.",

      "content": "Came across your blog the other day and tried this last night.  Absolutely fantastic. Incredibly deep mushroom flavor in the ravioli and the broth was amazing.  I added just a touch of parmesan and some chopped parsley to the filling, and some dried porcini's in addition to the morels to enhance the broth, and I cheated and used wonton wrappers instead of making pasta.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly and will definitely be doing it again.  Even my carnivorous 13 year old son went back for a second helping!",
