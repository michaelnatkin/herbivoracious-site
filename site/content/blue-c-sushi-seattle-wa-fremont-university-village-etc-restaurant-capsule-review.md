<p>Blue C Sushi is a conveyor-belt sushi restaurant with multiple locations in the Seattle area. Their first store, in Fremont, is close to my office so I've eaten there several dozens of times. It is great for a quick lunch because you can sit down and start eating immediately. Plates (with color codes for the price) circle around the modern, brightly lit room and you pick out whatever you want to eat. While you dine, you can watch the chefs make new mountains of sushi to serve.</p><p>Servers come by to offer you drinks and help out with special requests. When you are done, you just pile up your plates and press the blue button, and your server will total up and give you a bill. I find I'm typically satisfied with about 4 plates, so my tab with tax and tip usually runs about $12. </p><p>The quality of the food varies a bit. Sometimes I'll get an avocado roll that is absolutely perfect, and the next time it could be a little brown and slimy. It isn't a huge problem, just pay attention to what you grab to make sure it looks fresh and delicious. They do use good quality rice and nori.</p><p>My favorite vegetarian items are the green-bean tempura roll, tofu roll, sesame noodles, tofu salad, avocado and cucumber rolls, and the large veggie roll. I find their inari sushi (deep-fried tofu pockets filled with rice) to be sweeter than I like.</p> <p><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/4159/restaurant/Fremont/Blue-C-Sushi-Seattle"><img  alt="Blue C Sushi on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/4159/biglink.gif" style="border: medium none ; width: 200px; height: 146px;"></a> <br> <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/2863/restaurant/University-District/Blue-C-Sushi-Seattle"><img  alt="Blue C Sushi on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/2863/biglink.gif" style="border: medium none ; width: 200px; height: 146px;"></a> <br> <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/662686/restaurant/South-Seattle/Blue-C-Sushi-Seattle"><img  alt="Blue C Sushi on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/662686/biglink.gif" style="border: medium none ; width: 200px; height: 146px;"></a></p>
