These little offset spatulas are workhorses for pastry chefs. The offset-handle design keeps your hands out of the way of the work and lets you reach down into baking pans and get right up to the edge. They are also fantastic for frosting cookies and cupcakes. No more sticky fingers. I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MJL6FPC?tag=herb-hugo-20">the Ateco model</a> because it is dishwasher safe and the blade has just the right stiffness.
