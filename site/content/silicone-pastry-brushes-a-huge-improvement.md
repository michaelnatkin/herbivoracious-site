Old-school pastry brushes always drove me crazy. They never seemed quite clean no matter how much I washed them, and you couldn't put them in the dishwasher because the glue would loosen and the bristles would fall out. After awhile, the bristles would be all clumped together and even more frightening.

Silicone pastry brushes have changed the whole picture. They are heatproof up to high temperatures and go right in the dishwasher for 100% cleanup. It is a no-brainer.
