<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VA5HG0Q?tag=herb-hugo-20"><img title="L2501-2612_hd.jpeg" src="/images/2012/10/L2501-2612_hd.webp" alt="L2501 2612 hd" width="626" height="491" border="0" /></a>

Just as my <a href="/2009/11/my-skillet/">cast iron skillet</a> is my go-to pan for all kinds of frying and sautéeing, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VA5HG0Q?tag=herb-hugo-20">Le Creuset 5.5 quart French Oven</a> is the pot I turn to first for <strong>soups, stews, braises, chili</strong>, etc. It isn't quite big enough for boiling a full pound of pasta, but for anything else that involves sizable volumes of liquid, it is game-on.

Why is this a great pot?
<ol>
	<li>It is made from cast iron, which holds a lot of heat, so when you add food, <strong>the temperature doesn't drop</strong> as much as it would in a lighter pan.</li>
	<li>It is enameled, so you can <strong>cook reactive foods like tomato sauce</strong> in it that aren't appropriate for raw cast iron.</li>
	<li>It has a tight fitting lid that holds in moisture. <strong>It won't rattle</strong> as it simmers and let out steam.</li>
	<li><strong>It can go right in the oven. </strong>The handle on the lid is made from a composite that is good up to 500 degrees.</li>
	<li>It looks beautiful, and <strong>you can pick from a variety of colors</strong> to suit your style.</li>
</ol>
But… the real reason is #6: <strong>it just feels good</strong>. You know how <strong>some things have soul and some don't?</strong> These pots have soul. I can't really explain it any other way except that I just enjoy cooking in it, and will pretty much look for any excuse to do so.

What else can I say? These <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VA5HG0Q?tag=herb-hugo-20">pots are a sizable investment</a>, but I can't imagine you regretting the purchase. <strong>They also make a fantastic wedding present. </strong>I love to give gifts that the recipient will use their whole lives and pass on to their children, and this would be one of my top choices.
