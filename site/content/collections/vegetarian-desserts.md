I'm not a pastry chef and I don't pretend to be. What I do care about is the kind of dessert that ends a meal on exactly the right note — something with real flavor, made with solid technique, that doesn't require a degree in patisserie.

The apple crostata is more forgiving than a traditional pie and arguably better looking. The espresso brownies are the ones people ask for the recipe for. And the baked custard is the sort of thing you can make with what's already in your kitchen, which is when it tends to get made most.
