The appetizer course is where vegetarian cooking can really show off. These are the dishes that make people stop talking and pay attention to what they're eating.

A few of these lean toward the ambitious — the arancini and the chanterelle banh mi bites take some work — but they reward the effort, especially for a dinner party where you want to set a tone early. Others, like the asparagus with nori butter or the king oyster mushroom lettuce wraps, are simple enough for a weeknight when you just want something to pick at before dinner.
