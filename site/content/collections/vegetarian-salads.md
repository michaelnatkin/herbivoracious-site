A good salad is really about contrasts — sweet against sharp, crunchy against tender, rich against bright. Most of these are substantial enough to be a meal, and several travel well for potlucks or packed lunches.

The "caviar" lentil salad with crispy shallots is probably the one I've made the most over the years. And if you only learn one dressing, make it the lemon-mustard vinaigrette at the bottom of this list — it takes two minutes and works on almost everything.
