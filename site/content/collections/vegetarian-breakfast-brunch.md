Breakfast is where I'm least interested in following a recipe and most interested in good technique. But a few of these are worth making exactly as written — the Austin-style breakfast tacos, for instance, are dead simple but the details matter: warm tortillas, good eggs, the right salsa.

The Belgian waffles take planning ahead (the yeast dough rises overnight) but produce something in a completely different category from what you'd get out of a box mix. And the chilaquiles are what I make when we have leftover salsa verde and stale tortillas, which is often.
