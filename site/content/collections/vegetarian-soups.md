Vegetarian soups have a real advantage over their meat-based counterparts: the vegetables are the point, not an afterthought. That means the flavors tend to be brighter and more distinct.

The cold soups here — the chilled tomato buttermilk, the cucumber tarator — are worth seeking out when the weather is hot. And on the other end, the white bean and kale soup with a whole head of garlic is the kind of thing you want simmering on the stove when it's dark at 4:30. Many of these work well with a pressure cooker if you have one, which cuts the time considerably.
