Raising vegetarian kids means figuring out what they'll eat without resorting to the same five things on rotation. These are recipes that have actually survived the test of my own kitchen — dishes our kids either loved from the start or came around to over time.

I'm not a believer in making separate "kid food." The brown butter cornbread, the black bean soup, the arroz verde — these are meals we eat together at the same table. Some of them are inherently kid-friendly (pancakes, muffins) and some just happen to be foods that most kids like if you give them a chance.
