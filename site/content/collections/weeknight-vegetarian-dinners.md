These are the recipes I actually cook when I get home and need dinner on the table. No three-hour braises, no hard-to-find ingredients (mostly), no fussy plating. Just solid technique applied to good ingredients, with enough flavor to make you forget the question of whether there's meat on the plate.

A few of these, like the kale fried rice, are templates as much as recipes — use whatever vegetables you have around. Others, like the Korean yakisoba, reward a trip to an Asian grocery but come together in under 30 minutes once you have the ingredients.
