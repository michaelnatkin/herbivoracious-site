Herbivoracious is all about reinvigorating <a href="/2009/07/why-im-a-vegetarian-dammit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegetarian</a> cuisine with modern techniques and bold, authentic flavors. If this is your first time on the site, you might want to <a href="/welcome-to-herbivoracious/">start here</a>.

My philosophy is: I don't care whether you call yourself a vegetarian, carnivore, pescetarian or flexitarian. Labels don't matter. I want to make sure that if you cook a meatless meal tonight, it is hearty and delicious. That is the philosophy I bring to this blog, and <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my cookbook</a>.

My name is Michael Natkin, and I live in Seattle, WA with my wife and our two kids. For 25 years I was a software engineer specializing in computer graphics. I've worked at Adobe Systems developing <a href="http://adobe.com/products/aftereffects">After Effects</a>,  and helped bring dinosaurs and Terminators to life at <a href="http://ilm.com">Industrial Light and Magic</a>. Whenever I had a moment to spare, I spent it in the kitchen or reading and writing about food.
<p>
A few years ago I took a six month leave of absence. My family and I spent a month eating our way through Israel and Italy. Then I spent the next few months <a href="/2007/10/my-first-week-w/">interning in the kitchen at Cafe Flora</a>. In 2010 I also had the opportunity to stage at <a href="http://canlis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canlis</a>, one of Seattle's best known fine dining restaurants, and at New York's <a href="/2011/03/three-days-at-dirt-candy-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt Candy</a>.
</p>
<p>
As of March 2012, I've left the world of software and am fully committed to food. I've <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written a cookbook</a> for Harvard Common Press. My next goal is to open a small, innovative restaurant in Seattle. Stay tuned!

I've been a vegetarian since 1984. <a href="/2009/07/why-im-a-vegetarian-dammit/">Here's why</a>. I'm passionate about bringing big flavors and good culinary technique to vegetarian cooking. Not to say I don't also love a big plate of Waffle House hashbrowns.
