<span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial;">Grapefruit crudo, avocado, chervil and capers - this isn't tuna!</span>

I was goofing around with cutting citrus fruits into cubes the other day, and the red grapefruit looked so much like tuna. Not that I eat tuna, but of course I see other people eat it at sushi restaurants. I tried slicing it vertically into slabs instead, which was also beautiful. You could take this concept in a sashimi direction, but I opted for crudo instead - a.k.a. Italian sashimi. The avocado makes a perfect complement, adding that rich, contrasting mouthfeel to offset the bite of the grapefruit.

Crudo is typically dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and a citrus juice, which in this case is built in. I added capers, chervil and chervil. I haven't quite decided whether this dish works better cold or at room temperature. If you try it, let me know what you think.

To cut the grapefruit, use an uber-sharp chef's knife. Remove about a 1/2" or so slice from the top and bottom. Resting on the bottom, make four vertical cuts to produce a rough cube, removing all of the skin and pith. Now slice vertically into 1/3" thick slabs, avoiding the core. If you get just a little bit of core you can put that side down on the plate. Slicing grapefruit this way produces a lot of waste material. I think I got about 5-6 useable slices from a single fruit. So be sure and juice the rest for a cook's treat.
