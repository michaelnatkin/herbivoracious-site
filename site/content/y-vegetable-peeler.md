Good lord, you aren't still using one of those old-fashioned vegetable peelers where the blade is in the same line as the handle, are you? The motion and control with these Y-shaped peelers is so much more efficient, you'll be peeling your carrots and potatoes twice as fast. I like the minimalist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001AQI3IO/?tag=herbivoracious-shop-20">Kuhn Rikon peelers</a>, but if you want a more ergonomic handle, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DAQ5E/?tag=herbivoracious-shop-20">OXO peelers</a> are nice too. Whichever one you get, don't put it in the dishwasher - it will stay sharp a lot longer if you wash it by hand.
