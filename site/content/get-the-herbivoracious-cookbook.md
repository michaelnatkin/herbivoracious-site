    <p>Labels don't matter. If you want to eat a meatless meal tonight, I want to make sure it is hearty, beautiful, and absolutely delicious.</p>
    <p>I've written <em>Herbivoracious: A Flavor Revolution with 150 Vibrant and Original Vegetarian Recipes</em> to rid the world of bland, beige vegetarian food. If the idea of <strong>Crispy Polenta Cakes with White Beans and Morel Mushrooms</strong>, a <strong>Caramelized Apple and Blue Cheese Crostini</strong>, or beautiful <strong>Asparagus with Nori Butter</strong> makes you really hungry, this is the cookbook for you!</p>
    <p>Throughout the book, in the headnotes and boxes, I've got hundreds of tips that will help you go beyond the recipes to understanding the ingredients, techniques, and thought processes behind them, so you will become a better cook while making meals your family will love.</p>

## What is in the Book?

The book is hardcover, 368 pages, and includes 150 recipes and 80+ full color photos. When you plan a vegetarian meal, are you **unsure what to do for an entree**? I've included **over 40 hearty main courses**. You'll be able to build satisfying, healthful, attractive, and most of all, delicious meals around these dishes, with a large selection of appetizers, salads, soups and side dishes. Chapters on breakfast and some out-of-the-ordinary desserts round out the selection.

More than half of the recipes are either **vegan** or easily made so with simple substitutions, and the same is true for **gluten-free**.

    "His cookbook recipes range from everyday to ambitious, but his <strong>clear and straightforward instructions</strong> strip the intimidation from dishes with titles like Peppery Absorption-Cooked Red-Wine Capellini.
