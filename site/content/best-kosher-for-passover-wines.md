I recently had the opportunity to taste several kosher-for-Passover wines with a small group of wine enthusiasts at an event hosted by editor Joel Magalnick and Publisher Karen Chachkes of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jtnews.net/">JTNews</a>, Washington State's Jewish newspaper. Nine wines were poured by Michael Friend of Royal Wine Corporation, the world's largest producer and importer of kosher wines. <br><br>It was quite clear that <strong>kosher wine</strong> has moved far beyond the sickly sweet bottle of Manischewitz. I liked some of the offerings better than others, but all of them were right in line with similar non-kosher bottles at comparable price points. For a comprehensive overview, I recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1592642616?tag=herb-hugo-20">Rogov's Guide to Kosher Wines</a>. <br><br>I'll share my brief tasting notes here, and you should <a href="http://www.jtnews.net/index.php?/news/item/7226/C22/">click over to JTNews</a> for more in-depth analysis. <br><strong><br>White wines:</strong><br><br><em>Segal's Chardonay/Columbard Fusion</em> (Israel, $13.99) - crisp, acidic, not a lot of fruit. More tannic and bitter than I prefer.<br><br><em>Herzog Special Reserve Russian River Chardonnay 2007</em> (California, $34) - my favorite of the whites. Balanced, complex, with rounded tannins and a long finish.<br><em><br>Barkan Classic Sauvignon Blanc</em> (Israel, $11.99) - tingly, crisp, buttery and well balanced with mango/tropical fruit flavors. The best value of the whites.<br><br><strong>Red wines:</strong><br><br><em>Binyamina Yogev Cabernet/Merlot</em> (Israel, 13.99) - cherry on the nose, rather tannic and harsh, not much fruit on the palate. Unbalanced.<br><br><em>Segal's Specia Reserve Merlot</em> (Israel) - funky smell, too acidic for me.<br><em><br>Elvi Wines Classico</em> (Spain, $12.49) - a distinct aroma of black olives, straightforward and enjoyable. My pick for best value in the reds.<br><br><em>Goose Bay Pinot Noir</em> (New Zealand, $23.99) - it was an interesting sensation to switch to Pinot Noir after these darker, heavier wines. This one had a very specific aroma of sesame oil to me, which I found appealing.<br><br><em>Baron Rothschild Malbec</em> (Argentina, $24.99) - probably the world's only kosher Malbec. Young and aggressive. It reminded me of a teenager full of energy, but with some toasted notes as well. A young wine like this benefits from a good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01AVTQ1D4?tag=herb-hugo-20">wine decanter</a>. Enjoyable, probably my favorite of the reds.<br><br><em>Herzog Special Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2007</em> (Alexander Valley, California, $42) - the most expensive bottle we tasted, and the reason for that showed up in the complexity of black cherry and vanilla flavors. This is a powerful wine at 14% alcohol. A <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T1F5CSU?tag=herb-hugo-20">wine aerator</a> can help open up wines like these, and a quality <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Q53TG7?tag=herb-hugo-20">corkscrew</a> is essential for any tasting.
