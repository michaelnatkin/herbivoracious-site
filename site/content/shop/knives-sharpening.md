A good knife is the single most important tool in your kitchen. I'd rather cook with one sharp chef's knife and a cutting board than a kitchen full of gadgets. For vegetarian cooking especially, where you're doing a lot of slicing, dicing, and fine knife work on vegetables, a knife that holds an edge and feels right in your hand makes all the difference.

I'm a big believer in keeping your knives sharp — a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one, and it makes cooking a chore instead of a pleasure. Whether you go with a honing steel for regular maintenance or invest in an electric sharpener, the key is to actually use it. I sharpen my knives every week or two, and it takes less than a minute.
