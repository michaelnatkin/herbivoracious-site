Oils and vinegars are the unsung heroes of the kitchen. A finishing drizzle of good olive oil, a splash of sherry vinegar in a pan sauce, or a few drops of blood orange oil over a salad — these small touches make the difference between a meal that's fine and one that's memorable.

I keep several oils and vinegars on hand for different purposes. A neutral oil for high-heat cooking, a good extra virgin for finishing, a couple of vinegars for dressings and deglazing. It's worth investing in quality here, because you taste these ingredients directly.
