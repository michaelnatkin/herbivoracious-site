I love baking and dessert-making, and the quality of your sweeteners and chocolate really shows in the finished product. There's a world of difference between generic baking chocolate and a bar of single-origin dark chocolate, or between plain white sugar and the complex caramel notes of jaggery or sorghum syrup.

These are the ingredients that make desserts special — and many of them pull double duty in savory cooking too. A drizzle of good maple syrup in a vinaigrette, a pinch of smoked sugar on roasted vegetables, or a splash of agave in a cocktail. Keep a few of these on hand and your cooking will be better for it.
