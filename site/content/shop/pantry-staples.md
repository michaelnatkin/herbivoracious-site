These are the building blocks — the ingredients I always have on hand and reach for almost daily. Good salt (I'm a big fan of Maldon for finishing), canned San Marzano tomatoes, panko breadcrumbs, dried mushrooms for quick stock, and vegetable broth for everything from risotto to braising liquid.

This is also where you'll find some of the more adventurous pantry items I use in modernist cooking — things like agar agar, transglutaminase, and calcium chloride. You don't need those to cook well, but if you're curious about the techniques I explore on the blog, this is where to start.
