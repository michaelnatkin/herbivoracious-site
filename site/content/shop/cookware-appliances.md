Good cookware doesn't have to be expensive, but it does have to be the right tool for the job. A heavy-bottomed Dutch oven for braises and soups, a reliable skillet for searing, a solid blender for smooth purées — these are the workhorses that earn their place on the shelf.

For vegetarian cooking, I lean heavily on my Le Creuset Dutch oven, a bamboo steamer, and a good food processor. A lot of what we do involves building deep flavor from vegetables, and that means proper caramelization, even heat, and equipment that lets you work efficiently. I've tried to include a range of price points here — you don't need to buy everything at once.
