Latin American cooking is naturally generous to vegetarians — think black bean tacos, cheese-stuffed chiles, creamy esquites, and rich moles built from dried chiles and spices. The secret is having the right dried peppers, good masa, and a few key condiments on hand.

Dried chiles are the backbone of so many great dishes, and each variety brings something different — the fruity sweetness of ancho, the smoky depth of chipotle, the bright heat of de árbol. Once you start experimenting with them, you'll wonder how you ever cooked without them.
