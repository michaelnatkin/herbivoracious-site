Asian cuisines are a goldmine for vegetarian cooking. Between the fermented pastes, umami-rich soy sauces, aromatic curry pastes, and crispy noodles, you can build incredibly satisfying meals without ever missing the meat. I keep my pantry stocked with miso, kecap manis, rice vinegar, and a rotating cast of chili sauces.

Many of these ingredients keep for months (or years) in the pantry or fridge, so don't be afraid to stock up. Once you have a well-stocked Asian pantry, weeknight stir-fries, noodle soups, and rice bowls come together in minutes.
