I'm an obsessive cookbook reader. Not just for recipes — I love learning about the food traditions and techniques behind different cuisines. The books here are ones I've actually cooked from and been inspired by, from Andrea Nguyen's definitive tofu guide to the poetic food writing of Claudia Roden.

Whether you're looking for a comprehensive vegetarian reference, want to dive deep into a specific regional cuisine, or just want something beautiful to read on the couch, there's something here for you. I've also included a few books on food science and technique for the more nerdy cooks among us.
