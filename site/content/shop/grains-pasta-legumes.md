Grains and legumes are the foundation of vegetarian cooking — they provide the substance, the protein, and often the most satisfying textures in a meal. I'm a huge fan of farro for its nutty chew, polenta for its creamy comfort, and French green lentils for their ability to hold their shape in salads and stews.

Don't overlook specialty flours and pastas either. Double-zero flour for homemade pasta, buckwheat flour for crêpes, and good dried pasta from Italy can all be ordered online when your local store falls short. A well-stocked grain shelf means you're always twenty minutes away from a hearty meal.
