I try not to be a gadget person — I'd rather have a few great tools than a drawer full of unitaskers. But some gadgets genuinely earn their keep. A reliable instant-read thermometer takes the guesswork out of frying and candy-making. A Microplane grater turns a block of Parmesan into a snowfall of flavor. A good kitchen scale is essential for baking and for following recipes from pretty much anywhere outside the US.

These are the everyday tools I actually reach for, the ones that survive my periodic kitchen-drawer purges. If it's on this list, it's because I use it regularly and think you will too.
