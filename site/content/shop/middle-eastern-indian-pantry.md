Middle Eastern and Indian cuisines have centuries of tradition in meatless cooking, and the spice combinations are some of the most complex and rewarding in the world. Pomegranate molasses, sumac, za'atar, tamarind — these ingredients bring a depth of flavor that turns simple vegetables into something extraordinary.

I love keeping a well-stocked shelf of these ingredients because they open up so many possibilities: dal from scratch, proper hummus, fattoush with good sumac, or a quick chana masala on a Tuesday night. Most of these keep well, so it's worth building your collection over time.
