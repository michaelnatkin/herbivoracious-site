Good cheese can be the centerpiece of a vegetarian meal, not just a garnish. A sharp aged Asiago grated over pasta, a wedge of creamy Bleu d'Auvergne with bread and honey, or a scoop of fresh whole-milk ricotta folded into ravioli filling — these are the moments where quality ingredients really shine.

I'm particularly fond of artisan and farmstead cheeses. They cost more, but you use less because the flavor is so much more concentrated. When a recipe calls for Parmesan, reaching for the real thing makes all the difference.
