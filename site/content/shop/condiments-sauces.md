A great condiment can rescue a boring meal and elevate a good one. I always have a few bold sauces and pickled things in my fridge — a good Dijon mustard, a jar of capers, some kind of hot sauce, and usually something unexpected like pickled mango amba or a fig spread that pairs beautifully with cheese.

These are the flavor shortcuts that make weeknight cooking exciting. A drizzle here, a spoonful there, and suddenly that simple bowl of grains and roasted vegetables becomes something you actually look forward to eating.
