Baking is where precision meets creativity, and having the right pans and tools makes a real difference. A tart pan with a removable bottom, a good set of cake rings, quality pastry cutters — these aren't luxuries, they're what let you turn out professional-looking results at home.

I especially love baking savory vegetarian dishes — galettes, tarts, and layered gratins — and having proper bakeware means clean edges and even cooking. If you're just starting out, grab a silicone baking mat and a few basic ring molds, and you'll be amazed at how much more polished your food looks.
