Benriner Japanese Mandolin Vegetable Slicer

A mandoline is simply a sharp blade mounted on a flat platform, with adjustable screws to set the depth of cut, allowing you to make thin, consistent slices very quickly. Extra attachments allow for a variety of julienne cuts. The inexpensive Japanese models are just as good as, if not better than, the $100-plus European varieties. 

I use my mandoline constantly, for dishes like this <a href="/2011/12/persimmon-carpaccio-with-fennel-salad-recipe/" target="_blank">Persimmon Carpaccio</a> or the garnishes for these <a href="/2012/05/bibim-naegnmyeon-joll-noodles-cold-and-spicy-korean-noodles-recipe/" target="_blank">cold Korean Noodles</a>. It saves a ton of time and makes cuts far more consistent and beautiful than I ever could with my knife.

You might also like to buy a Kevlar kitchen glove to keep your fingers safe from the blade.
