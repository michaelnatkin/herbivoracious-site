It is safe to say that <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">every published cookbook</a> has mistakes in it. The beautiful thing about the web is that I can note them here in real time. Here are the errors I know of so far. Some are fixed in the 3rd printing. If  you've found another mistake, please drop me a note at <a href="mailto:michael@herbivoracious.com" target="_blank">michael  herbivoracious.com</a>.
<ul class="NormalBullets">
	<li><strong>Stovetop smoking method, used in several recipes</strong> - I no longer recommend jury-rigged stovetop smoking. I've since learned that creating smoke in a low-oxygen sealed environment like this creates unnecessarily high levels of carcinogens. See my <a href="/2013/01/smoked-tofu-buns-recipe/">Smoked Tofu Buns</a> recipe for a safer alternative if you don't have your own method of smoking.</li>
	<li><strong>Caramelized Apple and Blue Cheese Crostini</strong>, p. 57 - The apples should be cored. There is no need to peel them unless the peels are unusually tough. (Thanks, John Hughes!)</li>
	<li><strong>Jicama, Radish, and Orange Salad </strong>- This salad is also nice with some fruity olive oil added to the orange juice before tossing.</li>
	<li><strong>White Bean and Kale Soup</strong>, p.94 - For the pressure cooker method, better to add the salt at step 4, otherwise it might make the beans tough.</li>
	<li><strong>Iraqi-Jewish Eggplant Sandwich (Sabich) - </strong>not a mistake, but if you can't find amba, I've come up with a <a href="/2012/09/quickie-amba-pickled-mango-condiment-recipe.html#comments">fresh version</a> of it I really like.</li>
	<li><strong>Indian Fry Bread Tacos</strong>, p. 147 - "Grandma" from the Amazon reviews program, who lived on the Navajo reservation for several years, says that milk is never used in fry bread. The dish comes out delicious as written, but if you are concerned about authenticity you might want to use water instead and add a few tablespoons of vegetable shortening. I haven't tested this alternative. (Thanks, "Grandma"!)</li>
	<li><strong>Loaded Otsu Noodles</strong>, p. 168 - Include the lemon juice and zest along with the other sauce ingredients in step 1. (Thanks, Sarah Wallen!)</li>
	<li><strong>Caramel Cooked Tofu</strong>, p. 189 - If you have trouble getting the sauce to thicken, you might be using a pot that is too deep and not wide enough. This works best in a wide skillet. An easy fix is to pull the tofu out and finish cooking the sauce by itself for an extra minute, then pour it over the tofu.</li>
	<li><strong>Arroz Verde </strong>- It is best to let the rice cool for a little while before tossing with the herb puree, otherwise it has a tendency to get mushy. If you like, you can gently reheat it before serving.</li>
	<li><strong>Broccoli Raab/Rabe</strong>, p. 227 - Rabe is the preferred spelling.</li>
	<li><strong>Apple-Celery Sorbet</strong>, p. 300 - Ascorbic acid (crushed up pure vitamin C tablets) is more effective at preventing browning than citric acid or sodium citrate. (Thanks, Dave Arnold!)</li>
</ul>
