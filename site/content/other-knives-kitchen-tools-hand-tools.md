<p>Besides your <a href="/chefs-knife-kitchen-tools-hand-tools/">chef's knife</a>, you'll want to have a small paring knife and a good serrated bread knife. If you were to add just one more knife, especially for vegetarian cooking, I would make it a "tomato knife," which is a little larger than a paring knife but serrated to slice easily through the tough skins of tomatoes, grapes, and the like.</p>
<p>Here are 3 solid choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085V5Q2JR?tag=herb-hugo-20">WÜSTHOF Classic 3.5" Paring Knife</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005MEGZ?tag=herb-hugo-20">WÜSTHOF Classic 8" Bread Knife</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00375MLNE?tag=herb-hugo-20">HENCKELS Forged Premio Serrated Utility Knife, 5-inch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The paring knife is probably the most debatable, but this one fits my hand great. I use it comfortably to remove strings from celery, core tomatoes and strawberries and lots of other repetitive tasks.</p>
