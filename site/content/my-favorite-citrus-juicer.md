I use a lot of lemon and lime juice in my cooking, so I've tried quite a few ways to get that juice over the years. I've tried wooden reamers (ugh, my hand is covered in juice!), one-piece counter models (rarely strain well), and electrics (only really worthwhile if you need to do dozens of lemons at a time). For my money, this simple citrus squeezer is the way to go.

Pros: 

<ul class="NormalBullets">
	<li>You get just about every drop of juice. (Tip: start with cut side up, then flip and squeeze again to get more.)</li>
	<li>Easy to clean.</li>
	<li>Doesn't take up much space.</li>
	<li>Simple - no loose pieces to misplace.</li>
	<li>Catches most/all of the seeds.</li>
</ul>

The only negative I can point to is that it isn't the heaviest duty item in the world; I do wash mine by hand (which just takes a second) to extend the life and I have used it regularly for a few years with no problems at all. 

Find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002BFZ16?tag=herb-hugo-20">citrus juicer</a> I recommend on Amazon.
