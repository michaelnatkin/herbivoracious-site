<p>I wanted to let you know about a service I just learned about. <a href="http://www.eatyourbooks.com/" target="_blank">EatYourBooks.com</a> has a very clever idea. You have a shelf full of dozens or hundreds of cookbooks, right? But it is a pain in the butt to find all the eggplant recipes in them. So you use the web instead and end up with a bunch of dubious recipes. (Unless you find them on my site; then you know they are solid gold, baby :).</p><p>On EYB, they have 16,500 cookbooks indexed. You tell it which ones you own, and then you can search them. It probably won&#39;t have every book you own, but you can request them for later indexing. In just the 24 books I&#39;ve entered so far (which took 10 minutes), I can see 99 eggplant recipes, narrow it down to 22 Indian ones, and see that there is Eggplant Pakora with Poppy Seeds in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0525245642?tag=herb-hugo-20">The Art of Indian Vegetarian Cooking</a> and Andhra Spiced Eggplant in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1579652077?tag=herb-hugo-20">Mangoes and Curry Leaves</a>. Sweet. I&#39;m going to get a lot more use out of my cookbooks.</p><p>I should note that EYB did give me a free membership - but of course I&#39;m telling you about them because I think it is a killer service, not because of the freebie. They have a free trial, so check it out. </p><p>I should also mention <a href="http://www.gobbledybook.com" target="_blank">GobbledyBook.com</a> by Seattle food photographer extraordinaire, Lara Ferroni. The idea is similar, but it is always free and if the book you want isn&#39;t in there, you can index it yourself. So it is a more open solution, but because of that it has much less content (5,000 recipes vs. 250,000). You&#39;ll have to decide for yourself whether you&#39;d rather go DIY for free or pay $25/year to use a bigger database.</p><p>And speaking of indexing your recipes, I just built this new <span class="removed_link" title="https://herbivoracious.com/recipeGallery">visual index to all of the recipes on Herbivoracious</span>. Check it out and let me know what you think!</p>
