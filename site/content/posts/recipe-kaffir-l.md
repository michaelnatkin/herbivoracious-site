I've been wanting to find a good way to get a strong flavor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_lime">kaffir lime</a> leaf, and this really worked out great. </p>  <p>I should mention that kaffir lime is considered an offensive term, although it is by far the most commonly used name for this plant. Makrut lime is more acceptable. But I've never actually heard it used. The leaf infuses a big, round citrus flavor without any acidity. The closest substitution would probably be normal lime rind but it is by no means the same. You should be able to find it at a good Asian specialty market, especially one that offers a Southeast Asian selection, or an Indian grocery.</p>  <p>The idea with this sauce is to get a nice balance of sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and the citrus. Once you mix it up, give it a good taste and adjust any of the components to get exactly what you want.<br /><div class="recipe-card">
