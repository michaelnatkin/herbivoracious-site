Scientifically, they are the same thing. The sour taste buds fire when an acid meets water and releases hydrogen ions in your mouth. <strong>End of chemistry class.</strong></p><div style="width: 130px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; border: 1px solid; padding: 5px; background-color: #F2F5A9;"><strong>Read the Series</strong><br><ol> <li><a href="/2010/01/crunch-acid-salt-fat-1/">Salt</a></li> <li><a href="/2010/01/the-value-of-acid-making-your-food-pop-part-2/">Acid</a></li> <li><a href="/2010/01/spare-the-fat-spoil-the-flavor-making-your-food-pop-part-3/">Fat</a></li> <li><a href="/2010/02/things-that-go-crunch-in-the-night-making-your-food-pop-part-4/">Crunch</a></li> <li><a href="/2010/01/when-it-all-goes-wrong-making-your-food-pop-part-3andahalf/">A Telling Failure</a></li> </ol></div><p>At least in America, acidity is a quality frequently missing from home-cooked meals, especially in what we think of as comfort food.<br><br>I'm not speaking here of the cases where acid is needed for a technical purpose, like preventing the browning of peeled artichokes, or reacting with baking soda in a pancake batter. I'm talking about sour flavors, which have a place in almost any dish. <strong>Why?</strong></p><p>First of all, acid stimulates the palate. Specifically, the <strong>production of saliva</strong>. Just imagine sucking on a lemon for a second and I bet your mouth literally waters. That is the very definition of appetizing: you are physically preparing your body to eat.</p><p>Also, acid gives the sensation of <strong>cutting through fat.</strong> A sauce that might seem too rich is magically enlivened. The classic heavy French sauces, like hollandaise, mayonnaise and bearnaise all include a crucial acidic component. You probably wouldn't like to dress a bowl of lettuce with just oil, but oil and <a href="/2008/02/recipe-citrus-s/" target="_blank">vinegar</a> <a href="/2009/05/lemon-mustard-vinaigrette-the-simplest-and-best-salad-dressing-recipe/" target="_blank">or lemon juice</a> is a staple.</p><p>Finally, sourness <a href="/2008/04/recipe-syrian-y/" target="_blank">balances out sweet or salty flavors</a>. Think of a crepe dusted with powdered sugar and a squeeze of lemon, or salty fries dipped in sweet and tart ketchup. Less obviously, even a basic vegetable or <a href="/2008/04/recipe-syrian-y/" target="_blank">lentil soup</a> delivers mostly sweet, earthy flavors. That same squeeze of lemon makes it much more interesting.</p><p>For the best effect, consider the balance of flavors for the whole meal, not just a single dish. If dessert is going to be a tart cherry pie, maybe <a href="/2008/01/recipe-white-be/">lemony white beans</a> aren't the ideal appetizer.<br><br>Things that can add sourness: any citrus juice, any of the <a href="/2008/10/whats-in-my-pantry-part-1-liquids-by-the-stove/" target="_blank">hundreds of wonderful vinegars</a> on the market, wine, tomatoes, tamarind, fruits (especially when underripe), anything pickled, amchoor powder (an Indian spice made from dried mango), and carbonation. Yep. CO2 dissolved in water produces a little bit of <strong>carbonic acid</strong>, which is part of why seltzer is so refreshing.</p><p>Speaking of citrus, don't forget to look beyond standard lemons and limes. Grapefruits, mandarins, tangerines, pomelo, Meyer lemons, yuzu, and even Buddha's Hand offer amazing variations. <p>There are also times when you don't want or need any more acidity in a dish, but you still want some of the effects. In that case, consider citrus zest or kaffir lime leaves. Although they aren't really significantly acidic, they have such a strong association with the fruits that you will experience a similar effect. The zest of a lemon added to a simple tomato sauce is amazing.</p><p>So remember to taste your food frequently, throughout the cooking process. And once you are satisfied that the salt level is correct, ask yourself, "would a little splash of acid wake this puppy up?".</p>
