  name: "Caramelized Pear and Ginger Scones"
  ingredients:
    - "For the pears:"
    - "2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
    - "3 medium or 2 laege crisp pears, cored, peeled, finely diced"
    - "pinch Kosher salt"
    - "1 tablespoon sugar"
    - "2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger"
    - "¼ teaspoon cinnamon"
    - "For the scones:"
    - "5 cups all-purpose flour (23 ounces)"
    - "1 tablespoon baking powder"
    - "1 teaspoon baking soda"
    - "½ cup sugar + 3 tablespoons for topping"
    - "1 ½ teaspoons Kosher salt"
    - "1 cup (two sticks) very cold unsalted butter cut into tablespoons + 2 tablespoons melted for topping"
    - "1 ½ cups buttermilk"
  instructions:
    - "Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pears, salt and sugar and cook, stirring occasionally until most of the liquid has cooked off and the pears are starting to brown, about 6 minutes."
    - "Add the ginger and cinnamon and cook 2 more minutes. Set the pears aside to cool."
    - "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Butter 2 baking sheets or cover them with a silicone mat."
    - "Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ½ cup sugar and the salt. Cut 1 cup of the butter into the flour, using either two knives, a pastry blender, or a food processor, or even your hands with a squeezing/rubbing action between the fingers. Keep blending until the butter is broken down in to oatmeal sized pieces for flaky scones, or until fully powdered in a food processor if you prefer tender, less flaky scones."
    - "Add the buttermilk and pears and mix with a wooden spoon, moistening all of the dry ingredients. (If using the food processor, you can add the buttermilk to the bowl and process until a shaggy ball forms, then knead in the pears in the next step). You might need another tablespoon or two of buttermilk, but don’t be in a hurry to add it, we want the dough to just barely form a mass."
    - "Turn out on to a floured board and knead as briefly as possible to make a rough ball."
    - "Flatten the dough into a rectangle about 24” x 4 ½”. Brush the top with melted butter and sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar. Cut into 6 even rectangles and then divide each rectangle into two triangles. Transfer to the baking sheets, leaving two inches between scones."
    - "Bake until quite golden brown, about 22 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve with butter and jam."
