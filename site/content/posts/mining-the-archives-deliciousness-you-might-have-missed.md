<p>I&#39;m got some commitments that will keep me from posting as many new recipes as usual for the next couple of weeks. I&#39;ve been writing Herbivoracious for nearly three years now, and we&#39;ve got lots of readers that weren&#39;t around in the early days. So I thought I&#39;d feature a couple of delicious older posts that you might have missed. </p><p>&#0160;<a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340133ec3e2ad7970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Sabich-small" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340133ec3e2ad7970b " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340133ec3e2ad7970b-500wi.jpg" /></a>&#0160;</p><p><a href="/2008/04/recipe-sabich-/" target="_blank">Sabich</a> is an Iraqi-Jewish sandwich with grilled eggplant, hardboiled eggs and lots of interesting condiments; if you can&#39;t get it at your local Middle Eastern restaurant, you can make it at home.</p><p>&#0160;<a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb883401310fe46891970c-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Atayef" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb883401310fe46891970c " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb883401310fe46891970c-500wi.jpg" /></a>&#0160;</p><p>... and if you have a sweet tooth, these <a href="/2008/04/recipe-atayef-/" target="_blank">atayef</a> (Syrian pancakes, filled with ricotta, deep fried, and soaked in rose water syrup) will knock your socks off. <br /> </p>
