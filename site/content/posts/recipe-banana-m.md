I want to taste banana, not overpowering sugar. This version is a composite of several recipes, putting together all the bits that we like (borrowing the most from <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Banana-Crumb-Muffins/Detail.aspx">this one</a> at Allrecipes). Mini-me had a great time sprinkling on the crumb topping, which has a few flakes of sea salt in it.</p>  <p>By the way, how do you like that vintage <a href="http://www.notagaingraphics.com/Branchell/br3a.html">Melmac</a> serving plate? I have a few hundred pieces of the stuff, the remnants of an even larger collection from my post-college years. I think I'll start busting them out for more blog photos.</p>  <p>It occurred to me afterwards that caramelizing the bananas first to bring out even more of their flavor might be good. That or using some of the smaller, intensely flavored bananas that good stores carry these days. If anyone tries either of those ideas, please comment and let me know how it turned out!</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
