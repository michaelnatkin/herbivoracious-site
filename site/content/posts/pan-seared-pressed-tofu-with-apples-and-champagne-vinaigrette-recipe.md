<em>Pan Seared Tofu and Apples with Champagne Vinaigrette and Pomegranate Seeds</em>

I stopped by <a href="http://bcove.me/rsh55wgj" target="_blank">Northwest Tofu</a> the other day and came home with their beautiful pressed tofu, along with regular tofu (still warm) and <a href="/2011/12/crispy-yuba-tofu-skin-rolls-recipe/" target="_blank">fresh yuba</a>. Casting about for a lunch I could throw together in just minutes, I tossed the pressed tofu in <a href="/2009/11/my-skillet/" target="_blank">my skillet</a> and rummaged around in the fridge to see what would could join the party.

Now normally I use tofu almost exclusively in Asian dishes. I'm not inclined to go pureeing it into milkshakes or stuffing it into lasagna. But when I saw a container of leftover pomegranate seeds (well, arils if you want to be technical) marinating in champagne vinaigrette, flavored with lots of fresh thyme, it just jumped out at me that it would be delicious with the super-fresh, well browned tofu. Then I thought of the Braeburn apples that <a href="http://www.fullcircle.com/" target="_blank">Full Circle</a> had brought, and five minutes later, this salad was born.

At least, I guess salad is the right name for it since the apples aren't cooked and it has a vinaigrette, but really this is plenty hearty enough to be a one-dish meal.

This tofu has had so much of the moisture removed that it browns really quickly and easily. It almost reminds me of grilled halloumi cheese, which I think would also be excellent in this dish. I'm not sure you will get the same results with the prepackaged pressed tofu you often see at groceries. I often find those aren't just pressed, but actually unpleasantly tough. Take this as an opportunity to get out and explore a local tofu shop in your town.. and if you know one, leave it in the comments so other folks can find them.

Needless to say, this salad dressing is delightful on lettuce too!
