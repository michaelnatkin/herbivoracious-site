They didn't hold up so well to reheating, and I didn't have all of the flavor components in place. I had some of the rice left at home and made them again the next day with much more success. This time I ditched the fruit-vinegar reduction, and added a sprinkle of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> and cinnamon, a slice of melting manchego, and candied <a href="/2008/11/holiday-shopping-for-gourmets-or-gourmands-chefshopcom/">Seville orange peel</a>. </p><p>I learned about the combination of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> (pimenton) and cinnamon from Mem, who writes <a href="http://vegetarianduck.blogspot.com/">Vegetarian Duck</a>, when he commented on my <a href="/2008/07/quesadilla/">crispy quesadilla recipe</a>. The combination sounded surprising to me, but when I tried it, I was blown away. Rather than tasting like two spices, it comes across as a married, individual flavor. I use a proportion of around 3:1 paprika:cinammon in savory dishes, and the reverse in sweets. I'm enamored, and putting it on everything.</p><p>Technically, paella cake is a pretty sketchy designation, but it conveys the idea of a Spanish variety of rice flavored with saffron. I didn't make a sofrito because I wasn't really looking for a tomatoey flavor here, but feel free to go that route. Rather than creating the crispy crust (soccarat) while initially cooking the rice, we make it in the frying pan.</p><p><strong>Paella Cakes with Manchego and Candied Seville Orange Peel</strong><br><em>Makes 12 cakes, serving 4-6 as a main, or 8-12 as an appetizer<br>Vegetarian; gluten-free if you omit the breadcrumbs; not vegan</em></p><ul> <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li> <li>1/2 white onion, small dice</li> <li>1/2 red bell pepper, small dice</li> <li>2 cups short-grained Spanish rice (a type sold for paella; in a pinch you could use an Italian variety like arborio)</li> <li>3.5 cups vegetable broth or water</li> <li>1 tablespoon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a><br> </li> <li>1 big pinch saffron</li> <li>2 eggs</li> <li>2 cups breadcrumbs (panko is fine)</li> <li>vegetable oil for pan frying</li> <li>12 slices manchego cheese</li> <li>3 teaspoons <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> mixed with 1 teaspoon cinammon</li> <li>candied Seville orange peel or high quality marmalade</li> <li>fresh ground black pepper</li> <li>sea salt</li> </ul> <ol> <li>In a large pot with a tight fitting lid, heat the olive oil over a high flame. Saute the onion and bell pepper for 3 minutes. Add the rice and saute for 2 minutes, until slightly translucent. </li> <li>Add the vegetable broth or water, 1 tablespoon of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> (taste first; if yours is hot, adjust down unless you like that sort of thing), and the saffron. If the broth isn't salty, add 1 tablespoon of salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce to bare simmer. </li> <li>Cook until all of the water is absorbed. Taste a few grains. If they aren't fully cooked, add a bit more water. They should have just a hint of toothsomeosity left, we definitely aren't looking for mushy.</li> <li>Allow the rice to cool. If you are in a hurry, spread it on a sheet tray and refrigerate.</li> <li>Taste the rice and adjust seasoning. Beat the eggs and mix them in. You should have a mixture that you can just barely squeeze into a patty in your hand. Put the breadcrumbs in a flat dish.</li> <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a good amount of oil to the pan so the patties will crisp up. Working quickly, grab a handful of rice, form it into a rough patty, press it into the breadcrumbs on each side and add to the skillet. Gently shape into a nice cake, not too thick - we want the eggs to set inside.</li> <li>Fry until quite crispy and brown on one side, then flip and top immediately with a piece of manchego. Fry until the other side is also crispy and remove to paper towels. </li> <li>To serve, dust your plates with the paprika/cinammon, add the patty(s), and top with about 1 teaspoon of the orange peel, some sea salt, and fresh ground pepper.</li> </ol> <a href="http://www.foodista.com/recipe/WYCDYZ7C/paella"><img alt="Paella on Foodista" src="http://static.foodista.com/images/foodista_logo_101_20_flattened.png?foodista_widget_NYQY4KN6" style="border:none;width:101px;height:20px;" /></a>
