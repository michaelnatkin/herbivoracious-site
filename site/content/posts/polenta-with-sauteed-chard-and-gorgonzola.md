A lazy weekend day meant I had time to make polenta the slow way instead of using the quick cooking (but not instant) de La Estancia brand. I followed Marcella Hazan&#39;s &quot;no-stir&quot; method, which really isn&#39;t no-stir, but definitely low maintenance, you just need to have an hour. Both the quick-cooking and slow-and-low methods make delicious polenta, but they are very different. The de la Estancia is bright yellow and tastes more of fresh corn, with a slightly rougher texture. Hazan&#39;s technique leads to polenta which is very mellow, creamy, soft and soothing.</p> <p>Whenever I make polenta, I almost always double the batch and chill the rest on a oiled baking sheet. The next day I cut it into squares and cook it in a skillet with a bit of oil. The fried pieces with soft insides are delicious with a simple tomato sauce. The recipe below is for four, but will work fine to double or triple as long as you use a big enough pot.</p> <p>The polenta is definitely the main event in a dish like this, and we don&#39;t want to overwhelm it. Strong flavors are fine but they should be in moderate amounts. I&#39;d say the amount of blue cheese in the picture above is too much by half. I added just a few slivers of garlic and a pinch of chili flakes to the chard, and a drizzle of good balsamic on the side to round out the dish.</p> <p><strong>Polenta With Sauteed Chard and Gorgonzola</strong><br /><em>Serves 4<br />Vegetarian and gluten-free; vegan if you omit the cheese</em></p> <ul> <li>7 cups water</li> <li>1 tablespoon salt</li> <li>1 2/3 cup polenta (medium to coarse grained yellow cornmeal)</li> <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan</li> <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li> <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced thin</li> <li>optional: 1/4 teaspoon chili flakes</li> <li>1 large bunch Swiss chard (any color is fine), leaves pulled from stems, washed, and chopped coarsely</li> <li>6 tablespoons gorgonzola dolce or other blue cheese</li> <li>Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt) or other finishing salt</li> <li>black pepper</li> <li>optional: balsamico tradizionale</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Bring water and 1 tablespoon of salt to a boil. Whisk the polenta in a thin stream into the water, stir for 2 minutes being sure to reach the bottom of the pot, reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover. Every ten minutes, uncover the pot, stir for whole 1 minute, and re-cover until 40 minutes have elapsed. Then uncover and cook five more minutes, and stir in the grated parmesan. Turn off the heat.</li> <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium-high flame. When it is shimmering, add the garlic and optional chili flakes. Fry for 10 seconds, then add the chard and 1 teaspoon of salt. Saute for a minute, add a little water, cover, and steam until thoroughly tender, about 7 minutes. Remove top and allow water to evaporate.</li> <li>To serve, ladle 1/4 of the polenta into a bowl. Top with 1/4 of the chard and 1.5 tablespoons of gorgonzola. Finish with salt, pepper and optionally a drizzle of balsamico.</li> </ol> <p><a href="http://www.foodista.com/recipe/THSCY7J8/polenta"><img alt="Polenta on Foodista" src="http://static.foodista.com/images/foodista_logo_101_20_flattened.png?foodista_widget_3WTNPFJC" style="border: none; width: 101px; height: 20px;" /></a></p>
