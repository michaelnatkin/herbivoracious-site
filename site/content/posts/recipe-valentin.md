Eric L., the creator of <a href="http://www.cellartracker.com/intro.asp">CellarTracker.com</a> normally leads the group, but he's down with a shoulder injury. So he and his family hosted at their beautiful house and provided amazing wine, and I led the cooking with a&nbsp; group of 13 enthusiastic sous chefs. It was great fun!</p>  <p>Normally I'd post the recipes in order starting with appetizers, but with Valentine's Day right around the corner, we better begin with a dessert to knock your sweetie's socks off. (Or other items of clothing). Although there are a few steps, it really isn't much harder than making pancakes.&nbsp; Add a chocolate ganache, quick raspberry compote, and whipped cream and I dare you not to be happy. Eric paired this with a Heitz ruby port which I think was ideal.</p>  <p>The batter recipe is classic Julia Child. You can make it a day ahead if you like. If you have <a type="amzn" asin="0375413405">Mastering the Art of French Cooking</a>, she goes in to her characteristic fine detail for perfecting your crepe technique. Page 190 in my well-worn old hardback copy that I inherited from my Mom. Definitely worth a look.</p>  <p><strong>Valentine's Day Crepes with Chocolate Ganache And Raspberry Compote</strong><br /><em>Serves 4-5</em></p>  <ul><li>4 T. melted butter</li>  <li>1 c. cold water</li>  <li>1 c. whole milk</li>  <li>4 eggs</li>  <li>2 c. sifted all-purpose flour</li>  <li>1/2 t. kosher salt</li>  <li>vegetable oil for the pan</li>  <li>8 oz. good bittersweet or semi-sweet (Scharffen-Berger or Callebaut are fine choices)</li>  <li>1 pint heavy cream (for ganache and whipped cream)</li>  <li>3 T. powdered sugar</li>  <li>one small bag frozen raspberries</li>    <li>sugar as needed</li>  </ul>  <ol><li>Combine the melted butter, cold water, milk, eggs, flour and kosher salt in the blender and whir for a minute. Refrigerate the batter until ready to use. Better if it chills for an hour, but not mandatory. The consistency should be like a quite thin pancake batter. Stir in a bit more cold milk if necessary.</li>  <li>Roughly chop the chocolate, add 1/2 c. of the heavy cream, and melt in the microwave or double boiler, whisking occasionally until smooth. Add more cream if needed to make a fluffy ganache. Do not refrigerate. (To do this in the microwave, heat at full power for 30 seconds at a time in a microwaveable bowl, stirring in between, until melted and smooth).</li>  <li>In a small pot, melt the raspberries, and whisk occasionally until they turn into a sauce. Add sugar, and a pinch of salt to taste. Continue to simmer until slightly thickened. A little lemon juice or zest is nice here too.</li>  <li>Whip the cream with the powdered sugar.</li>  <li>To cook the crepes, heat one or two crepe pans or 8&quot; non-stick skillets over a medium flame. Wipe with a bit of vegetable oil. Pour in 1/4 c. of batter, and quickly swirl to coat. Let cook until just slightly brown but not crisp, about 60 seconds, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds. </li>  <li>To serve, put a spoonfull of the ganache in the center of each crepe and roll or fold. Place on plate with a spoonful of the raspberry compote, drizzle with more ganache, and add dollop of the whip cream. Two crepes makes a good serving.</li></ol>
