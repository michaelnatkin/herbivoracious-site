The $64,000 question for Thanksgiving with vegetarians is what to do about the main course. There are two schools of thought:
<ol>
	<li>An entree is really important; a meal isn't a meal unless there is something is in the middle of the plate.</li>
	<li>Don't worry about it. The turkey, after all, is only one of about two hundred and sixty seven things on the table; most of the rest of them are vegetarian anyhow. It is one meal a year, just let the vegetarians eat all the delicious side dishes and save them an extra slice of pumpkin pie. (Like how I slipped that pie part in there?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I'm more in camp 2, at least if I'm joining an omnivorous Thanksgiving. It just isn't that big of a deal to me to be worth making a veg entree when there is so much else to eat. But if I was putting on my own fully vegetarian Thanksgiving, I'd pick one of these main courses:</p>
