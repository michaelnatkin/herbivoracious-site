<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Oatmeal-Chocolate Chip Cookies</span>

Sometimes in life you just want a big, warm plate of chocolate-chip cookies, and sometimes you want oatmeal chocolate-chip. At least that's what Sarina and her Mom tell me :).

I started with  this <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chewy-Chocolate-Chip-Oatmeal-Cookies/Detail.aspx">recipe from Panthera</a> and applied my usual cookie tweaks (more salt, more chocolate, chill the dough) with good results. I used regular rolled oats, not quick-cooking ones, which presumably resulted in a chewier cookie.

The original recipe calls for a cup of chopped walnuts too, which would be good - can't use 'em in my allergic house.  Or if you want to do raisins, don't let me stop you. You might want to cut down the white sugar by a couple of tablespoons too.

<strong>Oatmeal-Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong>
<em>Vegetarian, not vegan or gluten-free
Makes about 30 largeish cookies</em>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup butter, room temp or warm briefly in microwave</li>
	<li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
	<li>2 eggs</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or flaky sea salt (use only 1 for iodized salt or Morton's kosher)</li>
	<li>3 cups oats (see note above)</li>
	<li>1 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (Ghiradelli works well)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 325 F, using convection if available.</li>
	<li>In a stand mixer, cream together the butter and both sugars on medium speed until smooth.</li>
	<li>Add the eggs one at a time, continuing to beat. Add the vanilla extract and turn off the mixer.</li>
	<li>Combine the flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl, then add to the mixer and briefly mix, scraping down the bowl a couple of times.</li>
	<li>Add the oatmeal and briefly mix.</li>
	<li>Add the chocolate chips and briefly mix.</li>
	<li>Chill the dough for about 1/2 hour. You can do this right in the mixer bowl.</li>
	<li>Using a small ice-cream scoop or a very heaping tablespoon, drop balls on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Silpat-Premium-Non-Stick-Silicone-Baking/dp/B00008T960?tag=herb-hugo-20">silpat</a> or ungreased baking sheet. Bake for about 14 minutes, until nicely browned.</li>
</ol>
