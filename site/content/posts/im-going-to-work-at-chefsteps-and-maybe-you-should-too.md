I know I've said here very publicly that the next thing I wanted to do was open a small restaurant. Well, sometimes incredibly cool opportunities happen when you least expect them. The chance to work with alumni of the Modernist Cuisine team? Hell yes. I'll still be posting here at Herbivoracious, but probably a little less frequently than usual. Wanna know what I'm doing in the picture above? <a href="http://www.chefstepsblog.com/2012/11/what-im-doing-at-chefsteps-and-maybe-you-should-be-here-too/" target="_blank">Jump over to ChefSteps</a> for the scoop. (And if you are a badass web developer, be sure and read all the way to the end.)
