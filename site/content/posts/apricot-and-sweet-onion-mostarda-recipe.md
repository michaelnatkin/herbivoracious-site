  name: "Apricot and Sweet Onion Mostarda"
  yield: "about 1 cupVegetarian, vegan, and potentially gluten-free (be sure and check the pre-prepared ingredients)"
  ingredients:
    - "5 large or 8 small apricots (about 400 grams total)"
    - "3 tablespoons sugar"
    - "1/8 teaspoon salt"
    - "1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper"
    - "3 tablespoons sherry vinegar"
    - "2 tablespoons Dijon mustard"
    - "dash Tabasco"
    - "1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds and 1 teaspoon fennel seeds ground in a mortar and pestle"
    - "1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger"
    - "1/2 sweet (Maui, Vidalia, Walla Walla, etc.) onion, finely diced"

    - "Combine all of the ingredients except the onion in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer, adding a little water as needed. Cook 15 minutes, stirring occasionally."
    - "Take off the heat and puree (using an immersion blender if you have one). Strain through a coarse sieve to remove the apricot skins."
    - "Return the puree to the cleaned pot, and add the finely diced onion. Simmer about 15 more minutes until quite thick (remembering that it will thicken a bit more when it cools; you want the end result to be something like a pickle relish)."
    - "Taste and adjust seasonings to give a nice balance of fruity, sweet, sour and piquant/mustardy."

It is made most famously in Cremona (and is sometimes known as mostarda di Cremona), though I first tasted it much further south, at a restaurant in Siena that offered three varieties at the table.</p>  <p>The flavor of mostarda is a complex mixture of sweet and sour, fruity and pungent. It is traditionally served with blander boiled meats, but it also pairs well in small amounts as part of a cheese course (or an upscale grilled cheese sandwich). I would venture to say that if you find sweet pickles awful, this isn&#39;t for you, but if you like relishy stuff, you&#39;ll probably love it.</p>  <p>Modern chefs have taken this basic idea of mostarda and applied it to any condiment incorporating fruit, sugar and mustard. The recipe I&#39;m offering you today is definitely not traditional. I&#39;m using a single fruit (apricot), and cooking it down almost to a jam instead of keeping it in larger pieces. Sweet onion provides the structure and snap. </p>  <p>If you have mustard oil on hand (possibly from Indian cooking), you can use that, but I substituted a prepared Dijon mustard. The effect isn&#39;t quite the same but I think it is delicious on its own merits.</p>  <p>If you aren&#39;t inclined to make your own, but want to taste mostarda, here are a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26redirect%3Dtrue%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fi%255F0%26keywords%3Dmostarda%26qid%3D1253335023%26rh%3Di%253Agourmet%252Ck%253Amostarda&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">plethora of options on Amazon</a>. </p>  <div class="recipe-card">
