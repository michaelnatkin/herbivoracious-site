As much as I love this dish, I couldn't finish them all off. I just happened to have some leftover broth from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mushroom-House-Dried-Shiitake-Mushrooms/dp/B007RAM3VK?tag=herb-hugo-20">dried shiitake mushrooms</a> lying around, and it hit me that the two together would make a nice soup. Shiitake broth is a favorite for me because if you have the dried mushrooms in your pantry, you can have a rich stock in just 15 or 20 minutes. I use it a lot as the vegetarian base for stir-fry sauces instead of chicken broth. Here's the soup &quot;recipe&quot;, if you can call it that! The savory flavors of the mushrooms and caramelized onions make a rich base for the lentils and rice. As simple as this sounds, it is pretty rapture inducing.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
