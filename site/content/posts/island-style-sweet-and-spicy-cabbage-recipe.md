Sad to say, I can&#39;t recall which island (possibly Barbados?), but I do remember that he moonlighted in a steel drum band, and we would often cook simple dinners together and hang out in his room watching Golden State Warriors games.</p> <p>He had this unlabeled bottle of hot sauce that friends would smuggle in when they came from home, and it was unlike any other I&#39;d tasted. There was lots of chili heat, but almost an equal hit of mustard, so much so that the sauce was yellow. Probably similar to this <a href="http://www.cosmicchile.com/site/lottie-s-hot-sauce.html" target="_self">bottle of Lottie&#39;s</a>. This sauce could be used at the table, but what I loved even more was how he cooked with it.</p> <p>The first thing to go in the pan with the oil was always minced onions and brown sugar. After the sugar caramelized a bit, in would go the hot sauce. Then the main ingredient, whatever it was, would be fried in this intensely flavored base.</p> <p>I don&#39;t have this type of hot sauce on hand, and you probably don&#39;t either, so I decided to see if I could get a similar result by building the sauce directly in the pan. I liked the result a lot; it was hot, sweet, full of spice, and quite close to how I remember the taste of John&#39;s cooking. Today I used this technique on napa cabbage, but you could adapt it to just about anything from potatoes to paneer. Okra would be amazing.</p> <p>I served this cabbage with dhal puri roti (an Indo-Caribbean flatbread filled with yellow splitpea dal), and Jamaican rice &amp; peas.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear from anyone who is familiar with this style of cooking that begins with sugar and hot sauce in the pan. Are there other niceties to this technique? Is it particular to certain islands?</p> <div class="recipe-card">
