<p>Today marks the 100th anniversary of Herbivoracious. When I started this blog, back in nineteen-ought-seven, my pal Burnsie, looking natty as always in his sateen knickers, offered me advice that every writer would do well to remember: &quot;Just give the great unwashed a pair of oversized breasts and a happy ending, and they'll 'oink' for more every time.&quot;</p>  <p>Mmm, sorry, Simpsons reverie. What I meant to say was, when I <a href="/2007/07/the-vegetarian-/">started this blog</a> 99 posts ago, it was a real shot in the dark. I had no idea how to do it, how much time it would take, or what would make for a good or bad post. I just knew that I needed a way to share my obsession with more folks than my (incredibly patient) family and friends. I've been passionate about great vegetarian food for&nbsp; 20+ years, and I know that there are lots of people who feel the same way. So many of you have been kind enough to comment on the blog or email me privately with encouragment and feedback, and that really keeps me going. </p>  <p>Anyhow, for a 100th post I figured it would make sense to look back and highlight a few favorites. Especially since there are new visitors all the time, this list might make a good starting point. By all means comment if you think some of these are duds or other ones belong here. </p>  <p>And most of all, thanks for reading, cooking, eating, and sharing!</p>  <table cellpadding="10"> <tbody> <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/10/recipe-mujadara/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/10/07/mujadara.webp" /> </a> </td>  <td> This <a href="/2007/10/recipe-mujadara/">recipe for Mujadara</a> has been consistently one of the most popular on the site. The simple pilaf of rice and lentils with lots of caramelized onions is easy and nutritious, uses ingredients that are available year round, and has such an earthy, satisfying flavor. </td></tr>   <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/08/edamame-in-an-e/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/08/15/odetosoy_1_of_1.webp" /> </a></td>  <td> <a href="/2007/08/edamame-in-an-e/">Edamame in an Edible Tofu Bowl</a> is one of my personal favorites because it looks dramatic but goes together in just a few minutes. Oh, and I'm crazy about using circle cutters to present food. Don't ask me why, it just makes me happy. </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td><a href="/2007/10/hummus-peace-su/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/10/15/taamihummus.webp" /> </a>   </td>  <td> If I could eat one thing right this minute, it would be a bowl of <a href="/2007/10/hummus-peace-su/">real Middle Eastern hummus</a>. This was from our big trip to Israel and Italy earlier this fall. </td> </tr>  <tr valign="top"><td><img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="http://www.reedsgingerbrew.com/images/brews.webp" /></td>  <td>One of the things that restaurants do which most home cooks don't consider is simple reduced sauces. Almost any wine, juice, vinegar, broth, cream, or any flavorful liquid you can think of can be quickly boiled down to intensify flavor and a thicker consistency so it can be served as a sauce. The <a href="/2007/07/grilled-peaches/">Ginger Beer reduction</a> in this recipe is a good example of something a little out of the box but very tasty. </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/08/eggplant-parmes/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/08/12/eggplant_eating.webp" /> </a></td>  <td> My theory is that the only folks who don't love <a href="/2007/08/eggplant-parmes/">eggplant parmesan</a> are the ones that haven't had a good one. Gooey cheese, crispy breadcrumbs, well roasted eggplant, and a lively tomato sauce, what is not to love?   </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/08/caramelized-pea/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/08/23/pearandbluecheesecupcakes.webp" /> </a></td>  <td> These <a href="/2007/08/caramelized-pea/">Caramelized Pear Cupcakes with Blue Cheese Frosting</a> probably raised more eyebrows than most posts.   </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/10/my-first-week-w/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/10/19/cafefloraexterior.webp" /> </a></td>  <td> Without a doubt, making the leap to take six months off from my regular job to <a href="/2007/10/my-first-week-w/">intern at Cafe Flora</a> has been one of the best things I've ever done. I can't even begin to write down everything I've learned. It has been terrific to work with the amazing and talented people there, and see what it would take to open my own place farther down the road.  </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/11/recipe-how-to-m/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/11/07/fluffycouscous.webp" /> </a></td>  <td> Couscous is a favorite because it is a snap to make, and this <a href="/2007/11/recipe-how-to-m/">simple trick</a> makes it come out much more fluffy and delicious.   </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/10/one-day-of-work/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/12/12/cornmealpancakes.webp" title="Cornmealpancakes" alt="Cornmealpancakes" /></a></td>  <td> That looks more like cornmeal pancakes than <a href="/2007/10/one-day-of-work/">Spicy Angel Hair Pasta</a> to me, but you'll have to read the post to see the connection.   </td></tr>  <tr valign="top"><td> <a href="/2007/10/recipe-otsu-noo/"> <img width="100" hspace="5" align="left" src="/images/2007-small/10/09/otsunoodles.webp" /> </a></td>  <td> <a href="/2007/10/recipe-otsu-noo/">Otsu Noodles</a> have the subtle flavor of buckwheat soba and sesame paste balanced with refreshing cukes and green onions.    </td></tr></tbody></table>
