<em>Today's guest post is by my friend Kathy Strahs of <a href="http://paninihappy.com/" target="_blank">Panini Happy</a>. Last week, she hosted my <a href="http://paninihappy.com/spicy-caponata-panini-a-guest-post-from-michael-natkin-of-herbivoracious/" target="_blank">Spicy Caponata Panini</a>, and this week she's brought us a delicious sounding panini filled with cheddar, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NH57LQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">apple butter</a> and rosemary candied pecans. There are a couple of things I immediately like about this recipe. First of all, she's added the rosemary in two different ways, which is a smart way to develop complex and intense flavor. Second, the pecans add a crunchy element that makes the sandwich much more interesting. Take it away, Kathy...</em>

I’m honored that Michael invited me to guest post on his beautiful blog. His recipes often inspire us to take dishes to that next level – work with a new ingredient, try a new technique, go a little beyond the everyday. When it comes to the recipes I blog about over at <a href="http://paninihappy.com/" target="_blank">Panini Happy</a> I explore all kinds of unexpected uses for the panini maker – everything from pressing homemade ice cream cones to grilling smashed potatoes to baking mini layer cakes. And, of course, I also grill a whole lot of panini. Today, I’m dressing up a simple grilled cheddar cheese sandwich with a few unique twists.

Some of my readers might be thinking, “More cheddar and apples?” I can’t help it, this classic combination is a favorite of mine so I’ve grilled quite a few variations on it. But I never thought to involve rosemary before seeing Rosemary Apple Butter Grilled Cheese Sandwiches last week on <a href="http://framed-mylifeonepictureatatime.blogspot.com/2011/12/rosemary-apple-butter-grilled-cheese.html" target="_blank">Framed Cooks</a> (Kate originally found the idea on <a href="http://www.theprofessionalpalate.com/recipes/rosemary-apple-grilled-two-cheese.html" target="_blank">The Professional Palate</a>). I couldn’t get it out of my mind. Rosemary sounded like the perfect enhancement to cheddar and apples.

I decided to incorporate rosemary into my latest cheddar-and-apples panini in two ways. First, I tossed together some rosemary candied pecans to add a little sweet crunch and gentle heat (I spiced them with cayenne as well) to the sandwiches (caution: these pecans are <em>very</em> addictive!). Second, I grilled it all on buttered rosemary bread to bring in more of those subtle, woodsy rosemary notes.

I loved these panini. Each sweet and savory flavor and texture worked harmoniously. It takes a little extra time to make the pecans, but it’s well worth it – plus, you’ll have an amazing snack while you wait for the sandwiches to grill.

*Alternatively, if you don’t have a panini maker, you can always cook these sandwiches in a skillet or on a griddle over medium heat, flipping them once the cheese has melted about half way.
