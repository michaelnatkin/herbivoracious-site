Bought a large model that serves 10-12 because it is one of my dishes for dinner parties. I&#39;m really planning on using this one on my Big Green Egg in warmer weather, but with close to a foot of snow on the ground in Seattle and a full house with my folks in town, I decided to break it out and use it on my stove. Even with an imperfect burner arrangement, the rice turned out great. This was my first try with <em>bomba</em> rice, which many consider to be the finest, most absorbent variety.</p><p>If you live in Seattle, the Bay Area or Santa Fe, and haven&#39;t been to <a href="http://www.spanishtable.com/merchant.mvc?Screen=SFNT&amp;Store_Code=TST">The Spanish Table</a>, you&#39;ve been missing out. They have all of the good Spanish supplies - olives, olive oil, cheeses, saffron, pimenton, rice, piquillo peppers, and the knowledge to help you select items you&#39;ll love. Plus other great stuff from the regions near Spain, like North Africa and Portugal. Not to menion a terrific collection of wines, cookbooks, and tableware. If you don&#39;t live nearby, the same great items are on their website (<a href="http://">spanishtable.com</a>).</p><p>And in case you missed it, here&#39;s my <a href="/2008/07/vegetarian-pael/">recipe for vegetarian paella</a>.</p>
