recipe:
  name: "Giant Dutch Baby with Sauteed Apples"
  yield: "3 to 5 (see above)"
  diet: "Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-Free"
  ingredients:
    - "6 + 2 tablespoons unsalted butter"
    - "5 eggs"
    - "1 1/4 cups whole milk"
    - "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour"
    - "pinch salt"
    - "2 apples, peeled, cored, and sliced into 16 pieces each"
    - "2 tablespoons brown sugar"
    - "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon"
    - "powdered sugar"
    - "1 lemon, cut into wedges"
  instructions:
    - "Preheat your oven to 425 degrees."
    - "Combine the eggs, milk, flour and salt in a blender at high speed for 1 minute."
    - "Put the 6 tablespoons of butter into a well-seasoned 12\" cast-iron skillet or other large, oven-safe container. Put the skillet in the oven."
    - "When the butter is sizzling, carefully pull the skillet out and swirl it or use a brush to be sure the whole thing is coated. Pour in the batter and return it to the oven. Cook about 18 minutes until puffed and golden brown."
    - "Meanwhile, in a saute pan, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat. Add the apples and saute for 5 minutes. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt, and saute until tender and glazed."
    - "When the Dutch Baby is done, carefully remove it from the oven. Pad off any excess butter on top with a paper towel. Top with the apples and a generous sprinkle of powdered sugar. Since you have it in a really hot skillet, you might want to serve it directly on to plates rather than bring that to the table. Offer lemon wedges on the side, they add a nice counterpoint to the sweetness."

I happened to see Allen of <a href="http://www.eatingoutloud.com/2009/04/dutch-baby-pancake-recipe.html" target="_blank">Eating Out Loud's</a> post on Dutch Babies the other day, and I was reminded that my wife, Sarina, had fond childhood memories of them. I'd never had one before, but the recipe looked easy enough that I could pull it off while watching the kids so we could surprise her for Mother's Day. I'm glad I did, it was delicious.

If you have had <a href="http://www.foodbeam.com/2008/03/26/hoping-for-happy-accidents-le-clafoutis-de-ma-grand-mere/" target="_blank">clafoutis</a> before, Dutch Babies bear a lot of similarity. The batter has a bit less flour and more milk so it is a little more like a custardy than eggy. I think I might even like it a little better because there is less risk of getting an overcooked egg flavor.

I think this could easily be my new go-to brunch recipe. It has all of the right attributes: you can make the batter and the apples ahead, it finishes in the oven so you can hang out with your guests, and it is a little festive.

The preferred way to cook a Dutch Baby is in a cast iron skillet with a lot of butter in the bottom so that you get a little bit of a popover-type crust. It automatically puffs up and then sinks in the center, and you can then fill it with powdered sugar and fruit of your choice.

I like the savory direction that Allen went with it as well. The batter isn't sweetened, so I can see a lot of room to experiment. I'd like to try one with cubes of Swiss cheese and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a>. And conversely it could be dressed up into a full scale dessert with the addition of ice cream.

I <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1718,156188-227207,00.html" target="_blank">consulted</a> <a href="http://cookingwithamy.blogspot.com/2003/11/dutch-babyrecipe.html" target="_blank">several</a> recipes and came up with this version, which I think you will like. It is is the perfect amount for a big 12" cast iron skillet, and will serve 3 people if they are hungry and there are no other dishes, or about 5 if it is only part of a larger meal.
