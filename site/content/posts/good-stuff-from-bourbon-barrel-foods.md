I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky. In the 1970s. Not gonna lie to you. At that time it was pretty much a gastronomic wasteland, except for the not inconsiderable charms of Waffle House. Scattered, smothered and covered.. but I digress.

Bourbon has always been one of Kentucky's greatest exports. Even in the dark days, there was Maker's Mark and a handful of others making quality whiskey. Now the big houses like Jim Beam have many single-barrel upmarket products, and smaller producers such as Bulleit are making superb bourbons.

So it is only fitting that <a href="http://www.bourbonbarrelfoods.com" target="_blank">Bourbon Barrel Foods</a> is using ... wait for it ... bourbon barrels ... to age some absolutely beautiful, artisanal foods. They graciously sent me three samples recently, and I've enjoyed them all.

Fine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0079VJGL2/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">soy sauce</a> is a non-trivial undertaking, and frankly I was a little skeptical. I needn't have been. This one has a rich, complex flavor without any chemical or caramel-flavor notes.

The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035R8O12/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">bourbon-<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a></a> tastes as good to me as any from Spain. It isn't too spicy, and the smokiness level is just right to enhance an adult <a href="/2009/06/smoky-macaroni-and-cheese-recipe/" target="_blank">mac &amp; cheese</a> or this <a href="/2008/06/panko-crusted-e/" target="_blank">panko-crusted egg</a>.

And possibly my favorite, if forced to choose: the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0035R8O12/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">bourbon-vanilla sorghum</a>. Sorghum is a grass that is used mainly as animal fodder in America, though in other parts of the world it is an important cereal for people. When processed into a syrup, it has an intense flavor somewhat comparable to molasses. It might be an acquired taste for some, but I served it with pancakes for a group of 4 adults and 3 kids, and everyone enjoyed it. I think it would also be amazing with cornbread.

So there you have it. Some great products from my homeboys... makes me proud!
