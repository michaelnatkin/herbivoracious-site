They aren't very popular in America, but you can sometimes find a few items on a menu, especially at a South Indian restaurant. </p>  <p>I believe <a href="http://www.udupipalace.net/">Udupi Palace</a> in Bellevue, WA has <a href="http://onehotstove.blogspot.com/2006/01/street-food-pani-puri.html">Pani Puri</a>, which is one of the all time great chaat items, though I don't see it on the online menu. Those of you lucky enough to live in the Bay Area can visit the legendary <a href="http://www.vikschaatcorner.com/">Vik Distributors</a> in Berkeley, where you can load up on Indian groceries and have some of the best chaat snacks in the country. When I got a chance to travel to India, my coworkers <a href="http://www.delhitreats.blogspot.com/">Delhi Treats</a> and <a href="http://ayusman-foodie.blogspot.com/">Ayusman</a>, among others, took me to some of the best chaat places in Delhi and I think I left my heart there, or at least my palate.</p>  <p>If you know of a great chaat emporium elsewhere, please add a comment below!</p>  <p>Anyhow, I was longing for those flavors, and I had the idea to see if I could do a slightly upscale presentation. The main trick here was to make a bowl out of a papadum. All you have to do is cut a pie shaped wedge and put it on top of a ramekin, then toast it in the toaster oven and carefully press down on it until it forms a partial bowl. I topped that with spicy chickpeas, yogurt and cilantro, and on the plate we've got a bit of tamarind gel and slices of crystallized ginger. Here's the recipe:</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
