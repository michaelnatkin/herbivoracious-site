I&#39;m totally thrilled by that recognition, because I think Saveur presents some of the most interesting and authentic food writing and recipes out there, not to mention amazing photography. </p>  <p>It would mean a lot to me if all of you fine folks that are reading this would <a href="http://www.saveur.com/contest_bow.jsp?ID=1000011140" target="_blank">pop over to Saveur and vote</a>. It does require registration but that only takes a moment. And double bonus points if you would spread the word to your friends by sharing this page - you&#39;ll see links at the bottom of the post. <strong>Thank you so much for your support!</strong></p>  <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a8f0a0bc970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="float: right;"><img alt="Salter_scale" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a8f0a0bc970b " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a8f0a0bc970b-200wi.jpg" style="border: medium none ; margin: 0px; width: 200px;" title="Salter_scale" /></a> Now on to the freebie. By now I think a lot of people have heard that measuring by weight instead of volume is a much more reliable way to cook, and especially to bake. Ingredients like flour can vary wildly by volume, but using weight will give you consistent results. But not everyone has taken the leap to actually buying a scale. So when Cookware.com offered to <strong>give away</strong> this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0113UZJE2?tag=herb-hugo-20">nifty digital kitchen scale</a> to one of my readers, I couldn&#39;t say no.</p>  <p>I&#39;ll keep the contest simple: just go sign up for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/herbivoracious" target="_blank">Herbivoracious fan page on Facebook</a> by this Sunday (3/7/2010) and you are <strong>automatically entered</strong>. Monday morning I&#39;ll pick one member of the group at random and arrange to have the scale sent to them.<em> </em></p>  <p>Thanks again! Tommorow we&#39;ll get back to the recipes with some killer vegetarian potstickers (gyoza).</p>
