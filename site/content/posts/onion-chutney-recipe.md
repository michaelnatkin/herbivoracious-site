<p>When I was a freshman in college, I ate lunch at the many fine Indian restaurants in Providence, Rhode Island almost every day. This style of raw onion chutney was always on offer. Unfortunately, I’ve rarely seen it outside of the Northeast, and I didn’t see it at all when I was in Delhi.</p>
<p>If you don’t care for raw onions, you aren’t going to like this. But if you are like me, and crave that sweet, pungent crunch, this stuff is addictive.  It goes well with curries, and even better with fritters and pakora.</p>
