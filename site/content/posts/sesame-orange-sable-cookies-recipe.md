  name: "Sesame-Orange Sable Cookies"
  yield: "about 48 small cookies"
  ingredients:
    - "12 tablespoons (1 ½ sticks) room temperature butter"
    - "1 cup granulated sugar"
    - "1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt (use half as much for Kosher salt or any fine grained salt)"
    - "¾ cup toasted sesame seeds (white, black or a mixture)"
    - "¾ cup whole wheat pastry flour"
    - "¾ cup all-purpose flour"
    - "½ teaspoon baking soda"
    - "zest of 1 orange or 2 mandarin oranges"
  instructions:
    - "With a stand mixer or hand mixer, cream together the butter, sugar and salt at medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the sesame seeds and mix for 30 more seconds."
    - "Whisk together the whole wheat pastry flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda and orange zest. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and continue beating until it forms a dough, about 1 minute."
    - "Turn the dough out onto a light floured board and knead for a moment to form a cohesive ball. Divide into two pieces. Roll each piece into a cylinder about 8“ long. Be sure the dough is sticking together well; if not, roll it a bit more firmly. Wrap the cylinders tightly in plastic wrap, firmly roll on the counter a couple of times, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight."
    - "Preheat the oven to 375 and line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. Unwrap the dough. Using a sharp knife, slice each cylinder into generous ¼” cookies. Place the cookies on the baking sheets, leaving 1” between each cookie. Bake for 14-16 minutes until golden brown. Remove to a rack, cool, and serve."

<p>Sable doughs are a bit like shortbread, but with granulated sugar providing a delightfully sandy texture. They can be flavored with anything from chocolate to matcha tea with good results. My version incorporates enough sesame seeds to create something that is almost a cross between a cookie and those sesame sticks that you ate a pound of at Aunt Peg’s Superbowl party.</p>
<p>I’m generally cautious about using whole wheat flour in desserts, reserving it for cases where the heartier flavor enhances the other ingredients. With sesame and orange zest, it is a natural fit.</p>
<p>If you have raw sesame seeds, toast them in a skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and fragrant. Don’t walk away for long, they can get burned and bitter in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Serve these cookies with tea and a bar of good bittersweet chocolate for a real treat.</p>
