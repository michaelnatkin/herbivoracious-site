They are great with a beer, or as part of a complete meal with rice and a curry or noodle dish.</p>  <p>The traditional way to eat these salads is to use Thai sticky rice to pick them up, or wrap them in lettuce or cabbage leaves.</p> <p>Once you appreciate their basic aesthetic, you can readily improvise your own <em>yams</em>. Feel free to include just about any tropical fruit, raw or lightly cooked vegetable, or roasted peanuts. Go ahead and adjust the heat level to your preference, and add or subtract from the dressing. For example, you could replace the cilantro in this recipe with Thai basil or add garlic, or fresh ginger, or lemongrass ... you get the idea!</p> <p>A word about the chilis in this dish. The most typical Thai choice would be bird chilis. They are tiny, and wicked hot. If you don&#39;t have them, serranos or even jalapenos would be a good alternative. Remove the seeds and ribs and make the dressing an hour in advance if you want it mild, or include everything and mix the chilis in at the last minute if you want maximum kick.</p> <p><strong>Thai Tofu Salad (<em>yam taohu</em>)</strong><br /><em>Vegetarian, vegan and gluten free<br />Serves 4 as part of a larger meal</em></p> <p><em>For the dressing:</em></p> <ul> <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce (be sure and choose a gluten-free variety if needed)</li> <li>6 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li> <li>1 teaspoon sugar (preferably palm sugar)</li> <li>1-3 Thai bird chilis or serrano peppers, seeds and ribs removed (or see above)</li> <li>1/2 cup thinly sliced shallots, preferably the large red variety</li> <li>salt</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Combine all ingredients.
