<em>Saffron-Date Posset</em>

One of the many great things about working at <a href="http://chefsteps.com" target="_blank">ChefSteps</a> is that at any given moment, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007P4W0OI/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">amazingly delicious things</a> are subject to appear on top of the staff-food fridge, which means "come 'n get it." A few weeks ago, Grant or Ben or Nick, I'm not sure, put up posset.

Poss-what? Believe me, I had to ask. Posset. It is a classic English dessert, made simply of cream set into a pudding, but with acid instead of starch or egg. Starch and eggs both have a tendency to <strong>suck up flavor</strong>, and egg adds a flavor of its own, so the nice thing about posset is that it tastes only of cream and whatever you flavor it with, plus the tartness from the citric acid. (Traditionally, posset was set with wine or ale, but the citric acid is much easier and more predictable.)

Posset is also crazy easy to make. Grant sent me the base recipe as a text message: You just bring cream, sugar (15% of the cream weight), and any flavorings up to 85 C, stir in the citric acid (0.7% of the cream weight) and pour it into ramekins. Two hours of chilling later: presto, the creamiest, richest pudding imaginable.

The version I made today is flavored with date sugar and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007P4W0OI/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">saffron</a>. I went ahead and cooked it sous vide to give the saffron time to infuse, but you could absolutely do this on the stovetop as well. I was going for a Persian set of flavors, so the garnish was fresh dates, candied peel from a preserved lemon, pistachios and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PNYKLG/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">pistachio oil</a>, with a few leaves of lemon thyme and grains of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006FS4TI/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">my beloved Maldon salt</a>.

But you should absolutely feel free to improvise; posset would be good with any flavor that can handle a little sour bite from the acid. I could see honey-flavored posset, or vanilla of course, or Grant was working on jasmine posset... it is so flexible and easy that you'll go back to it all the time.

Oh, and speaking of fun things about ChefSteps - as much as I love doing food photography, it is really cool to be working with <a href="http://www.chefsteps.com/about" target="_blank">Ryan</a> and Kristina. I love the way Kristina got the light from the windows to just glance through the preserved lemon, like stained glass.
