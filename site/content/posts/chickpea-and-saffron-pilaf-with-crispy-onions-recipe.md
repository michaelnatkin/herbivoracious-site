<em>Chickpea and Saffron Pilaf with Crispy Onions</em>

The secret of this pilaf is using the flavorful oil leftover from making the crispy onions to saute the rice before adding any water. It adds a rich, savory background that makes the dish more satisfying.

I'll happily eat this as a main course with nothing more than a last-minute squeeze of lemon, but it also plays nicely as a side dish in a larger Middle Eastern spread. It also works well for summer potlucks because it doesn't need to be served hot.

By the way, did you ever wonder how restaurants make saffron rice with some grains tinted and others pure white? It doesn't take two pots. You make the rice as usual, then drizzle a bit of saffron-infused water on one side of the pot and let it absorb before fluffing.
