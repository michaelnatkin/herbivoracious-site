Corned beets. It started out <strong>more as a pun</strong> then anything else, but I figured beets cooked with the spices typically associated with corned beef would be good. Then I tried an iteration with the ChefSteps <a href="http://creations.chefsteps.com/chefsteps-house-rub-01/" target="_blank">House Rub 01</a> and that was also fantastic.

In any case, it is the texture that makes these beets delightful. They are completely cooked, yet they have a <strong>satisfying chew</strong>. First I cook them in the brine, then dehydrate them. On the first try, I dehydrated for far too long and they turned into dry, salty chips. I was just about to throw them in the compost when <a href="http://www.chefsteps.com/about" target="_blank">Grant</a> suggested I try rehydrating them. Voila! The excess salt washed away, there was still a nice bite from the spices, and the texture was awesome.

The flavors, both of the beets and the resemblance to cured meats suggest the right accompaniments. They are terrific on a simple sandwich of toasted rye or pumpernickel with just some <strong>mayo and strong mustard</strong>. If you happen to have some leftover crispy shallots from last week's <a href="/2013/02/vietnamese-cabbage-and-herb-salad-recipe/" target="_blank">Vietnamese salad</a> though, holy cow your sandwich just got an awesome crunch added to it. Or, you can take the beets and fancy them up a little like in the photo above - with toasted German pumpernickel, sour cream, pickled shallot, capers, and watercress. Whatever you do, be sure to include something with an <a href="/2010/01/the-value-of-acid-making-your-food-pop-part-2/" target="_blank">acidic punch</a> to play against the earthiness of the beets.

If you want to use the corned beef spices, make up just the spice mixture part of this <a href="http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/home_cured_corned_beef/" target="_blank">recipe from Elise</a> and then measure out the amount you need.

I've only ever made this recipe by cooking the beets sous vide and drying them in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Z915M4/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">fancy-pants dehydrator</a>, and rehydrating them in a chamber vacuum. But I don't see any reason why it shouldn't work to cook them in a pot, dry them in a low oven, and rehydrate (more slowly) without a vacuum. You'll have to experiment a little, but it should be just fine. If you do, please report back! I've given my best-guess directions below.
