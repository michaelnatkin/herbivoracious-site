<p>We just got back from a fun trip to Los Angeles, which by definition means a lot of great eats. I don't have it in me to do individual reviews for each of these restaurants, but I thought I'd at least post a roundup. Obviously you could eat for a lifetime in LA and not go to every good restaurant, but we were really happy with our choices. D.M., who is a frequent commenter on the blog and one of Sarina's dear friends did a lot of research and pointed us in great directions, and my old pals Nic and Lorna showed us some of the best Middle Eastern food we've had outside of Israel. </p>  <p>The address and phone info for all of the restaurants is at the very end of the post.</p>  <p>Our first night in town we had an early reservation at <a href="http://www.mozza-la.com/osteria/about.cfm">Osteria Mozza</a>, the upscale Italian restaurant from the powerhouse trio of Nancy Silverton, Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich on Melrose Ave. We shared a starter of magnicifiently fresh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrata">burrata</a> with leeks. My entree was a giant ravioli filled with ricotta and a sunny-side egg that spilled into the brown butter sauce when cut. It was quite spectacular but maybe a bit underseasoned. For dessert we had bombolini (little fried donuts) with vanilla gelato, and grappa. This is definitely a treat and a dining event, but well worth the splurge.<br /><br />Bookending our trip, our last meal before leaving town was right next door at <a href="http://www.mozza-la.com/pizzeria/about.cfm">Pizzeria Mozza</a>. The pizzeria is considerably less formal and expensive than the Osteria, but man oh man the pizza. It was really a revelation. The crust was cracker thin, but somehow crispy and chewy at the same time, with not the slightest hint of sogginess. The outer rim of the crust puffed up about an inch high, but was light as a feather, filled with enormous holes like you find in great artisan bread. Which is of course the explanation - Nancy SIlverton knows a thing or two about flour, water and yeast and she's used her decades of experience to design a pizza dough unlike any other. Gotta have it. You need reservations here even for lunch, but if you go 15 minutes before they open and wait in line you could get a first-come seat at the counter.</p>  <p>Brunch at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-vida-pacific-palisades">Cafe Vida</a> in Pacific Palisades was pleasing. The Cafe has a light, happy neighborhood feel and the food was fresh and tasty. If you go on the weekend you'll probably have to wait a bit and arm wrestle dogs and babies for a seat, but&nbsp; it will be worth it.</p>  <p>If you find yourself in the San Fernando Valley and in need of lunch, check out <a href="http://www.villapiacere.com/">Villa Piacere</a>. The decor was somewhat dated, but all of us were really happy with our big entree salads. LA really gets big salads in general, much more than Seattle. Probably because of all the diet nuts down here, but for whatever reason it is nice to lay into a big bowl of lettuce and veggies that look alive and carefully arranged. That is all we ate, so I can't speak to the rest of the menu. The hostess was really sweet too, obviously very proud of her restaurant.</p>  <p>Ok, let's talk about Middle Eastern, specifically Lebanese food. <a href="http://westwood.sunnin.com/">Sunnin</a>, over on Westwood just north of Santa Monica was outrageously good. We're talking paper plates and flourescent lights here, so not much ambiance but the waiters are nice (and gruff at the same time). But man alive the food. We liked it so much we went back a second time. Hummus, tabbouleh, foul muddamas, rekakat, yogurt salad, fried cauliflower, and fatayer (a pastry filled with bitter greens and pine nuts) were all deep soul food for me. I wasn't as crazy about the mujadarah (kinda goopy) and the fried potatoes. The falafel was really decent but not world class. That fried cauliflower in particular was really something special. It wasn't battered at all, just fried to a deep golden brown and served with tahini for dipping. I would be so damn happy if a place this good opened up in Seattle. How about a glass of Jallab (date syrup and rose water on ice, topped with pine nuts)?</p>  <p>Chaya Venice is a hopping spot on Main Street. Wall-to-wall busy with a lot of beautiful people, and a menu that spans the globe from sushi to pasta. I was frankly a little skeptical, but I have to admit that my gnocchi was really well prepared, rich and flavorful.</p>  <p>Later in the week, Sarina's Dad took me to <a href="http://mcafedechaya.com/">M Cafe de Chaya</a> on Melrose, the casual dine-in or takeout place with the same owners as Chaya Venice. M Cafe's concept is modern <a href="http://mcafedechaya.com/about-what.html">macrobiotic</a> food and they are doing a great job. We had a bright red quinoa and beet salad, a sweet potato salad with wasabi, a chickpea salad, a few pieces of sushi, and a tasty dairy-free chocolate pudding. Everything had a lot of flavor, and the restaurant itself has a good, high energy vibe about it. Even though I was looking out on LA traffic, it felt like a spot on the beach.<br /><br />Back in Venice, make your way over to Abbot Kinney and stop at <a href="http://www.jinpatisserie.com/">Jin Patisserie</a> for remarkable modern Japanese pastries, tea service, and beauteous chocolates. They have a pretty little courtyard to enjoy them in. Stop in at <a href="http://www.tortoiselife.com/">Tortoise Life</a> next door for a killer collection of high-design housewares, stationary, idiosyncractic bits of clothing, and fabric that looks like wood veneer.</p>  <p>We stayed at the <a href="http://www.thehuntleyhotel.com/">Huntley Hotel</a> in Santa Monica. The Penthouse bar on the top floor of the hotel is a fancy-pants night club when the sun sets, but in the morning it is an incredibly pretty (and rather spendy) place to have breakfast. Windows run all the way around, giving you a clear view from the Valley, all along the beach, and over to the airport and downtown. The room is painted stark white, so when you ascend the elevator before your first cup of coffee and the sun is streaming in, you kind of feel like you entered heaven. It wouldn't be surprising if Morgan Freeman showed you to your table. And the food was surprisingly tasty, what with organic eggs and carefully cut fruit plates. </p>  <p>So you can see we had a terrific time! Whether you love LA or love to hate it, you can definitely eat well.
