<p><strong>Celery Soup with Fregola Sarda or Israeli Couscous</strong>
<br /><em>4 modest servings / 20 minutes</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>½ cup fregola sarda or Israeli couscous</li>
<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>½ cup finely diced white onion</li>
<li>1 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
<li>2 outer ribs celery, finely diced</li>
<li>juice ½ lemon</li>
<li>1 tablespoon shoyu</li>
<li>¼ cup grated parmesan or grana padano cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup very thinly sliced inner rib of celery</li>
<li>big handful celery leaves</li>
<li>fresh ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Set aside 4 serving bowls to warm. Place a pot that holds at least 2 quarts over medium heat. If using fregola sarda, skip to step 2. If using Israeli couscous, dry-toast it in the pot, stirring occasionally until light, brown.</li>
<li>Add the olive oil, onion, kosher salt, and diced outer ribs of celery. Saute until the vegetables have softened somewhat, about 4 minutes. Add the fregola sarda if using. Add 4 cups of water and bring to a simmer, then lower the heat. Cook until the pasta is just al dente, about 10-12 minutes (or check package directions).</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice and shoyu. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
<li>Divide the soup among the 4 bowls. Top with a sprinkle of grated cheese, the raw celery, the celery leaves, and a grind of black pepper. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
