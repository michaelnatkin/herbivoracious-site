recipe:
  name: "Celery Soup with Fregola Sarda or Israeli Couscous"
  ingredients:
    - "½ cup fregola sarda or Israeli couscous"
    - "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil"
    - "½ cup finely diced white onion"
    - "1 teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "2 outer ribs celery, finely diced"
    - "juice ½ lemon"
    - "1 tablespoon shoyu"
    - "¼ cup grated parmesan or grana padano cheese"
    - "1/4 cup very thinly sliced inner rib of celery"
    - "big handful celery leaves"
    - "fresh ground black pepper"
  instructions:
    - "Set aside 4 serving bowls to warm. Place a pot that holds at least 2 quarts over medium heat. If using fregola sarda, skip to step 2. If using Israeli couscous, dry-toast it in the pot, stirring occasionally until light, brown."
    - "Add the olive oil, onion, kosher salt, and diced outer ribs of celery. Saute until the vegetables have softened somewhat, about 4 minutes. Add the fregola sarda if using. Add 4 cups of water and bring to a simmer, then lower the heat. Cook until the pasta is just al dente, about 10-12 minutes (or check package directions)."
    - "Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice and shoyu. Taste and adjust seasoning."
    - "Divide the soup among the 4 bowls. Top with a sprinkle of grated cheese, the raw celery, the celery leaves, and a grind of black pepper. Serve immediately."
