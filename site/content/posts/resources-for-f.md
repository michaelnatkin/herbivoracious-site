<p>Everyone talks about eating locally and sustainably, but it isn't always that easy to track down all the great products available in your area. I bet that there are many more farmer's markets, u-pick-em farms, farms that sell direct, and other exciting stuff in your neck of the woods than you realize! I just learned from Nicole over at <a href="http://www.farmtophilly.com/">Farm To Philly</a> about <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/">LocalHarvest.org</a> and <a href="http://foodroutes.org/localfood/">FoodRoutes.org</a>. Both have search engines where you can look for say, a goat dairy near Seattle, or a farmer's market in Bozeman. Very cool stuff. Try them both, the databases are different, and there is lots of other great info on the sites as well.<br /> </p>
