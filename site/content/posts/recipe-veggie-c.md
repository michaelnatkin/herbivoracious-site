I&#39;m admittedly an oddball; comfort food for me ranges from <a href="http://www.wafflehouse.com/">Waffle House</a> hash browns (scattered, smothered, and covered please) to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idli">idli</a> with sambar and everything in between. But I know what she means, and it seems only fair to try and hook her up sometimes.</p> <p>I figured anything with a biscuit or dumpling top is a guaranteed winner, so I made some simple cornbread batter and dropped it on a casserole dish full of beans, onions and veggie sausage. It is pretty darn rare that I make anything that involves so much canned food, but this came out tasty. I served it with grated cheddar, Louisiana hot sauce, and a quick salad of diced cucumbers and radishes with dill, parsley and mint and a lime dressing.</p> <p>The cornbread was based on <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_22832,00.html">this Emeril recipe</a>, adjusted to what I had on hand. Heck, if I&#39;m busting out the canned food, might as well make with the Food Network stars too, right?</p> <p><strong>Veggie Chili with Cornbread Dumplings</strong><br /><em>Serves 4 as a main course<br />Vegetarian, not vegan or gluten-free but could be adjusted</em></p> <ul> <li>1 white onion, medium diced</li> <li>2 small cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li> <li>1 can diced tomatoes, preferably Muir Glen fire-roasted (nice smoky flavor)</li> <li>2 links Field Roast Mexican Chipotle vegetarian sausage (kinda spicy), or 8 oz. other veggie meat of your choice, cut into bite size chunks</li> <li>2 T. olive oil</li> <li>salt</li> <li>optional: tabasco, chili flakes, chili powder, ground ancho chilis, green chilis, whatever heat you like</li> <li>grated cheddar for serving</li> </ul> <ul> <li><span class="bodytext">3/4 c. cornmeal (I used de la Estancia polenta, which has a wonderful fresh-corn flavor)</span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">1/4 c. all-purpose flour </span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">1 1/2 t. baking powder </span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">1/2 t. salt </span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">1/4 c. yogurt</span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">1/4 c. whole milk</span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">1 egg </span></li> <li><span class="bodytext">2 T. vegetable oil</span></li> </ul> <ol> <li>Preheat the onion to 400 degrees.</li> <li>Put the onions, pinto beans, tomatoes, veggie sausage and olive oil in a casserole.
