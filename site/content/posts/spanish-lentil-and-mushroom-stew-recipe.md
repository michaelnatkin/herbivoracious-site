<p>Have you ever noticed how mushrooms that are cut thickly and browned are a completely different experience to eat than when sliced thin and sauteed as normal? Instead of cooking all of the water out of them, the surface simply gets seared and the interior retains a chewy texture. Delicious.</p>
<p>Here these thick, chewy mushrooms are paired with French green lentils, seasoned with olive oil, sherry vinegar and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I5PVVKA?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a> for a Spanish accent. You can use lentils de puy, or black Beluga lentils. Just don't use standard big green or brown lentils as they will turn to mush.</p>
<p>The lentils and mushrooms are garnished with a little salad of cherry tomatoes and basil. Especially with earthy, brown plates of food, I love to finish with something bright and fresh to add a little visual interest and lighten the flavors.</p>
<p>With a good baguette this would make a nice light and healthy meal, or a smaller portion can be the first course of something more elaborate.</p>

<p><strong>Spanish Lentil and Mushroom Stew</strong>
<br /><em>Vegan and gluten-free / Serves 4-6 / 40 minutes</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 small white onion, finely diced</li>
<li>3 cloves garlic, finely diced</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of olive oil for the lentils, 2 tablespoons for the mushrooms, 2 teaspoons for the tomatoes</li>
<li>2 cups French green lentils, picked over and washed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika (such as pimenton dulce)</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sherry vinegar for lentils + 2 teaspoons for the tomatoes</li>
<li>1 pound crimini mushrooms, quartered lengthwise</li>
<li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>12 big leaves of basil, chiffonade</li>
<li>black pepper</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In a large saucepan, over medium-high heat, saute the onion and garlic with 3 tablespoons of olive oil and a pinch of salt until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the lentils and 4 cups of water. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook, uncovered, until tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes. Drain.</li>
<li>While the lentils are cooking, put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in your largest skillet. If it isn’t big enough to hold the mushrooms in roughly one layer, work in batches. When the oil is shimmering, fry the mushrooms, turning occasionally until well browned on most sides. Season with ¼ teaspoon Kosher salt.</li>
<li>When the lentils are cooked, add the smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, and the sherry vinegar. Taste and adjust seasoning. I like there to be just an edge of vinegary sourness without it being overpowering.</li>
<li>Toss the cherry tomatoes and basil with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, 2 teaspoonsof sherry vinegar, and ¼ teaspoon Kosher salt.</li>
<li>To serve, divide the lentils into bowls. Top with the mushrooms, and top that with the salad. Give the whole thing a grind of black pepper and optionally another little dusting of smoked paprika.</li>
</ol>
