For long-baked dishes, it might not make that much difference. But take one bite of this <a href="http://www.calabrocheese.com/">Calabro's fresh cheese</a> and you might think you never had ricotta before. It has the same clean milky sweetness that you find in great fresh mozzarella, and a fluffy, light texture. </p>  <p>I like it on toast, or with a drizzle of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MG95VFP?tag=herb-hugo-20">honey</a>, or with a good piece of fruit. Just saying, gotta give props to these guys for keeping it real for 43 years. In Seattle I can reliably find the ricotta at Whole Foods, not sure what distribution looks like in the rest of the country. I only wish I knew where to find some of their other products.</p>
