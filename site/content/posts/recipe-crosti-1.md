I learned it from a Jacques Pepin cookbook ages ago. Fromage Forte of course means &quot;strong cheese&quot;, and it is the best way I know to use up all those odds and ends of good cheese in your refrigerator. You can use just about any mixture of quality cheeses, but this isn't a good place for &quot;grocery store&quot; cheddar type products. I like to have a mix of strong, mild, hard, and creamy, and blue cheeses to maximize the flavor. </p>  <p>The version I did for the Kavana event didn't have much blue cheese because I was serving a hunk of it with the polenta course (recipe coming soon). We served it with simple crostini, just slices of baguette brushed with olive oil and toasted briefly under the broiler.</p>  <p>All you do is trim any rinds and mold off, add a little white wine, garlic, and black pepper, and spin the whole thing in a food processor until it is pretty creamy. If it is too thick and you don't want to add more wine, you can use a little yogurt. It should be thick enough to stand up though, you don't want it runny. </p>  <p><strong>Fromage Forte (also sometimes spelled Fromage Fort)</strong><br /><em>Vegetarian (and obviously not vegan!)</em><br /><em>Makes about 2 cups for a crostini topping or dip</em></p>  <ul><li>1/2 lb. cheese scraps (see note above)</li>  <li>1/2 c. dry white wine</li>  <li>black pepper to taste</li>  <li>1 clove garlic (or more to taste)</li>  <li>salt if needed</li>  <li>yogurt if needed</li></ul>  <ol><li>Trim rock hard or gross parts off of the cheese.</li>  <li>Put the cheese, wine, pepper, and garlic in a food processor and spin for a few minutes until no large chunks remain and the texture is fairly smooth.</li>  <li>If needed, add more wine or yogurt, and salt.</li>  <li>Store in the refrigerator. The flavor improves over a couple of days, but it is very tasty right away.</li>  <li>Serve on crostini, either as is or you can run it back under the broiler to make the cheese brown.</li></ol>
