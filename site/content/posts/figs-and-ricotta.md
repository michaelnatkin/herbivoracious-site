Much like the <a href="/2010/10/shaved-summer-squash-composed-salad/" target="_blank">shaved summer squash salad</a> of a few weeks ago, these perfectly ripe figs were spectacular with a bare minimum of manipulation. I think I would like to do a whole dinner party where every course followed this aesthetic.</p>  <p>The additional ingredients are <a href="/2008/04/calabro-the-b/" target="_blank">Calabro ricotta</a> (the only national ricotta worthy of the name), lime zest, tarragon, blackberry honey, saffron, and a few tiny pyramids of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RRA9BG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000RRA9BG" target="_blank">Big Tree Farms salt</a>.</p> <p>This is quite a few adornments for a fig, but what makes it work is that you use tiny amounts of most of them. Each bite becomes exciting and different; one tastes like citrus and the next of herb, and another has the metallic tang of saffron.</p> <p>You can add a little visual interest by cutting the figs &quot;randomly&quot;, that is not parallel or perpendicular to the base.</p> <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340134880c2ff3970c-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Figs and Honey" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340134880c2ff3970c" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340134880c2ff3970c-500wi.jpg" title="Figs and Honey" /></a></p> <p>Needless to say, I&#39;ll give you a recipe, but you should absolutely take this as a concept and run with it in any direction you like. The same idea would work with a perfect peach. The lime could be lemon or yuzu or nothing. Tarragon could be shiso or basil or anise hyssop. Honey could be elderberry syrup or a drizzle of good balsamic vinegar.</p> <p>By the way, a great free tool both for discovering and storing these types of flavor combinations is <a href="http://cuuks.com/" target="_blank">Cuuks.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Figs and Ricotta</strong><br /><em>Vegetarian and gluten-free</em><br /><em>Serves 4</em><br /><em>5 minutes</em></p> <ul> <li>1/2 cup Calabro ricotta (or homemade)</li> <li>4 perfectly ripe figs</li> <li>1/4 cup blackberry honey</li> <li>8 small strips of lime zest</li> <li>12 fresh tarragon leaves</li> <li>big pinch of saffron, crushed</li> <li>pyramidal sea salt</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Form the ricotta into quenelles and put one in each of 4 bowls.</li> <li>Cut each fig into 3 odd-shaped pieces, and put the pieces from 1 fig in each bowl.</li> <li>Drizzle the honey in the bottom of bowls.</li> <li>Garnish each bowl with 2 strips of lime zest and 3 leaves of tarragon.
