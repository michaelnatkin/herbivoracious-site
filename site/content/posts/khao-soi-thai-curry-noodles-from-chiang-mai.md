This is one of my very favorite recipes from the book.</em>

Khao soi is an iconic dish from the Chiang Mai region of northern Thailand, though its roots are thought to be Burmese or Chinese Muslim. It inspires cultlike devotion among initiates.

You don’t find khao soi often enough at Thai restaurants in America, which is why I think it is well worth making at home. Fresh, soft egg noodles are served in a spicy coconut-milk broth redolent of homemade curry paste. Pickled cabbage or mustard greens, lime juice, and crispy fried noodles provide a balance of textures and flavors that cut the richness of the coconut.

The amount of fried tofu to use depends on the variety you find at your local Asian market. My favorite kind has a deep-fried skin but is still pretty dense inside. If yours is like that, you’ll want about 1 1/2 pounds. If you find instead the type that is light and pillowy all the way through, use only about 3/4 pound, since it is a much larger volume for the amount of sauce. The dish should essentially be a soup with, say, eight bites of tofu on top of the noodles, not just tofu glazed with sauce!

My version isn’t completely authentic; I skip making a second chili sauce (nam prik pao) that is used as a garnish and simply pass more of the curry paste for those who like more heat.
