(Here is the <a href="/2008/08/tea-smoked-lych/">first</a> in the series). This one I fried using the small-batch tempura batter from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0756631238?tag=herb-hugo-20">Morimoto: The New Art of Japanese Cooking</a>, and served it with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002YGSJQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">Togarashi-</a>spiced mayo, black sea salt, and a slice of lemon.</p>  <p>One of the indelible dining experiences of my life involved tempura. A Japanese colleague and I were traveling in Tokyo for Adobe, and our local marketing guy took us to a little restaurant that served nothing but tempura. (Note to engineers everywhere: let the marketing guys take you to dinner.) It was a beautiful place, with no tables and just a ten-seat counter, run by a husband and wife. Nothing was in English, so being a vegetarian I would have never wandered in by myself for fear I wouldn't have been able to communicate my needs. </p>  <p>Our host exchanged a few words with the chef and for the rest of the evening a magnificent series of tiny dishes was brought to us. Many courses were vegetarian anyhow, but when my friends had meat or fish, the chef would make me something special. It was the season for maitake mushrooms, which were especially delicious. There was no &quot;tempura sauce&quot;, just sea salt touch each perfect bite to. And superb sake. I was really glad I wasn't footing the bill.<br /> </p>  <p>Back to reality... my lychee bites pale in comparison to that reverie, but were still pretty tasty!
