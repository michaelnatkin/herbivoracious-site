</a><em>Kouftikes de Prasa (Leek Fritter) Sandwiches</em>

<em>Of all the new recipes I developed for the cookbook this has to be one of my favorites. I'm excited to share it with you as a sneak peek today. The contest in this article is over (Melyssa S. was the winner), but maybe you'd like to <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">order a copy</a>?</em>

All over the Middle East and even in India, a kofta is a little meatball or patty. There are a few vegetarian versions too. These kouftikes de prasa as they are affectionately known on the Sephardic side of my family, are made of leeks, bound together with breadcrumbs and eggs.

I like to up the ante by serving them in a pita sandwich with a spicy pickled cabbage flavored with preserved lemon and harissa. This transforms them from an appetizer into an entrée with street food flair.

The cabbage needs to sit for a couple of hours to soften. You can toss it together the day before and let it marinate in the refrigerator overnight, or in a pinch, just use plain shredded lettuce instead, and serve hot sauce on the side.

<strong>Kouftikes De Prasa Sandwiches
</strong><em>Vegetarian and kosher
</em><em>Serves 4 / 30 minutes active</em>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the spicy cabbage</span>
<ul>
	<li>2 cups finely shredded red cabbage</li>
	<li>½ teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
	<li>¼ cup white vinegar</li>
	<li>½ preserved lemon, finely chopped</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons harissa or Thai-style chile sauce (such as Sriracha)</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the leek patties</span>
<ul>
	<li>2 large leeks, white and light green parts only (about 12 ounces)</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
	<li>1/2 cup homemade breadcrumbs (page 000)</li>
	<li>½ teaspoon cumin powder</li>
	<li>¼ teaspoon Aleppo pepper or cayenne</li>
	<li>pinch cinnamon</li>
	<li>vegetable oil for shallow frying</li>
	<li>flaky sea salt</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">To finish the sandwiches</span>
<ul>
	<li>4 pita breads, lightly toasted or grilled</li>
	<li>20 thin half-moons of cucumber</li>
	<li>½ cup thick Greek yogurt or labneh</li>
	<li>sumac</li>
	<li>handful mint (or cilantro) leaves, torn</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>For the spicy cabbage: Thoroughly toss together all ingredients and refrigerate for at least two hours (the day before is fine too). Allow to return to room temperature before serving.</li>
	<li>For the leek patties: Cut the leeks in half lengthwise and then into ¼” half-circles. Wash in 3 changes of water and then dry thoroughly (a salad spinner works well for this).</li>
	<li>In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat the olive oil and saute the leeks until tender and starting to shrivel, about 5 minutes. (You can use the same skillet to fry the leek patties in a moment).</li>
	<li>Thoroughly mix the leeks, salt, eggs, breadcrumbs, cumin powder, Aleppo pepper or cayenne, and cinnamon.</li>
	<li>Put about 1/8” of vegetable oil in the skillet and set the heat to medium-high. Drop the batter in with a quarter-cup measure and use the back of the cup to smooth each patty into a circle about 4” in diameter. Make 8 patties total, which will require two batches. Fry each patty until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to paper towels and season with the flaky sea salt.</li>
	<li>To finish the sandwiches: Place two leek patties on a pita. Top with a handful of the spicy red cabbage, 5 cucumber slices, and 2 tablespoons of the Greek yogurt. Sprinkle a little sumac on the yogurt, and scatter a few mint leaves over the whole sandwich. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
