I&#39;m most definitely a flaky guy. Wait a minute, that doesn&#39;t sound right. Anyhow, there was an unbelievable biscuit recipe in the May 2007 issue (#85) of Fine Cooking magazine. I don&#39;t want to reproduce their recipe here since it is copyrighted, but I can tell you how it differs from your standard buttermilk biscuits. The basic thing is that you don&#39;t blend the butter into the flour. You simply cut it into small cubes, maybe 1/4&quot; on a side, and toss them in to separate. And when you roll them out, you fold the dough into thirds and reroll three times to create a lot of layers. You absolutely have to bake them on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049C2S32?tag=herb-hugo-20">cookie sheet with a rim</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NQGXJ5C?tag=herb-hugo-20">parchment</a>! They leak a little butter and I can tell you from previous experience that if you skip the rim, you might have an oven fire. Mini-me thought that was cool. The friends came for breakfast and we had the biscuits with baked eggs (filled with potato cubes, braised greens and Appenzeller cheese), u-pick-em blackberries and a green salad.</p><p>Update: Fine Cooking published the <a href="http://www.finecooking.com/recipes/flaky-buttermilk-biscuits.aspx" target="_blank">Flaky Biscuit Recipe</a> on their website. Be sure and follow the directions closely to get the best results.</p>
