I just wanted to say thank you a million times over for all of your support in the <a href="http://everydaychefchallenge.com/recipe-gallery/?round=all" target="_blank">Pacific Natural Foods Everyday Chef Contest</a>. With your votes, my Enfrijoladas de Espinaca won round 2. It was really cool to see the recipes my fellow bloggers made, as well as all of the non-blogger entries. There were lots of delicious sounding dishes.</p> <div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://everydaychefchallenge.com/recipe-gallery/?round=all" target="_blank"><img alt="Shiitake and Morel Ravioli" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb883401348736a164970c-500wi.webp" title="Shiitake and Morel Ravioli" width="200" /></a></div> <p>The<a href="http://everydaychefchallenge.com/recipe-gallery/?round=all" target="_blank"> final round of voting</a> has already started. This one is a runoff between me and <a href="http://www.elanaspantry.com/" target="_blank">Elana&#39;s Pantry</a> to see who wins a bootcamp at the French Culinary Institute. That would be an amazing opportunity for me. I would really appreciate it if you would vote again. You can vote every 24 hours through next Tuesday (10/12) if you are so inclined, and there is no need to register so it just takes a second. I&#39;ll be posting a daily reminder on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/herbivoracious" target="_blank">Herbivoracious facebook page</a> as well.</p> <p>Thank you all so much! Next week, back to our regularly scheduled recipes.</p> <p><em></p>
