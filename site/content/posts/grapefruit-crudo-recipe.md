Not that I eat tuna, but of course I see other people eat it at sushi restaurants. I tried slicing it vertically into slabs instead, which was also beautiful. You could take this concept in a sashimi direction, but I opted for crudo instead - a.k.a. Italian sashimi.</p><p>Crudo is typically dressed with olive oil, sea salt, and a citrus juice, which in this case is built in. I added capers, chervil, and a slice of avocado for some fattiness. I haven't quite decided whether this dish works better cold or at room temperature. If you try it, let me know what you think.</p><p>To cut the grapefruit, use an uber-sharp chef's knife. Remove about a 1/2" or so slice from the top and bottom. Resting on the bottom, make four vertical cuts to produce a rough cube, removing all of the skin and pith. Now slice vertically into 1/3" thick slabs, avoiding the core. If you get just a little bit of core you can put that side down on the plate. Slicing grapefruit this way produces a lot of waste material. I think I got about 5-6 useable slices from a single fruit. So be sure and juice the rest for a cook's treat.</p><p><strong>Grapefruit Crudo with Avocado, Chervil and Capers</strong><br><em>Serves 4 as an appetizer<br>Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free</em></p><ul> <li>2 red grapefruit, sliced as described above</li> <li>1 ripe avocado, thinly sliced</li> <li>about 12 chervil sprigs</li> <li>1 tablespoon capers, briefly soaked to remove some salt and drained</li> <li>2 tablespoons fruity extra virgin olive oil</li> <li>sea salt (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019N89VE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0019N89VE">Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt)!</a>)</li> <li>fresh ground black pepper</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Arrange grapefruit pieces pleasingly on a plate.</li> <li>Top each slice with 1 piece of avocado, 1 chervil sprig and a few capers.</li> <li>Drizzle olive oil on plate and fruit.</li> <li>Add a few grains of crunchy sea salt and some grinds of black pepper to each slice.</li> </ol> <img alt="Grapefruit on Foodista" src="http://static.foodista.com/images/foodista_logo_101_20_flattened.png?foodista_widget_4TJXVVXX" style="border:none;width:101px;height:20px;" />
