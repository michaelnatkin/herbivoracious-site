One of the pictures in that story showed a spicy chickpea stew over the couscous, but with no details. Anyhow, folks over there were asking for the recipe, so we put it up over there as a <a href="http://kitchen.apartmenttherapy.com/food/guest-post/guest-post-spicy-chickpea-stew-from-herbivoracious-037369">guest post</a>. I make this often for dinner parties because it is hearty, satisfying, and doesn't require any last minute cooking.</p>
