  name: "Black Bean Soup With Orange-Jalapeno Salsa"
  yield: "6"
  ingredients:
    - "6 cups cooked black beans (reserve cooking liquid if homemade)"
    - "2 bay leaves"
    - "3 tablespoons olive oil"
    - "1 white onion, diced"
    - "1 yellow bell pepper, diced"
    - "4 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "1 tablespoon dried oregano"
    - "1 teaspoon dried cumin"
    - "1 teaspoon or more smoked paprika (optional, adds a bit of smokiness without much heat)"
    - "6 fresh mandarin oranges (or fewer, larger oranges)"
    - "1/4 cup red onion, finely diced"
    - "1 (or more) jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced"
    - "Kosher salt"
    - "1 handful cilantro leaves"
    - "salt to taste"
    - "Mexican crema or sour cream (for vegan, use vegan sour cream or avocado slices)"
  instructions:
    - "Heat the beans and bay leaves in a soup-sized pot, with not quite enough liquid to cover. If you boiled them at home and have the reserved cooking liquid, use that. If not, just use water and optionally add a little vegetable broth powder. Bring to a simmer."
    - "In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and garlic and a big pinch of salt, and sauté for 5 minutes until starting to brown. Add the oregano, cumin and smoked paprika and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from heat."
    - "Pluck the bay leaves out of the beans. Stir the onion mixture into the simmering beans."
    - "Turn off the heat, and lightly puree the beans. See the discussion above for safe ways to do this. I like it about 75% pureed, with some significant texture left."
    - "Return to the heat. Add more water as needed to produce a thick soup, but thinner than a stew consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning. It will almost certainly need salt unless you used pre-salted canned beans. You may also find you want more cumin or smoked paprika. Allow to simmer for at least 10-15 minutes for the flavors to develop and marry."
    - "Meanwhile, make the salsa. Do this as close to serving time as possible, or at least reserve the cilantro separately, as it dies quickly. Cut the oranges into supremes ( Mix with the red onion, jalapeno, cilantro, and ¼ teaspoon Kosher salt. Taste and adjust seasoning."
    - "To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and either garnish with approximately 3 tablespoons of the salsa and some cream, or pass them separately."

<p>I developed this black bean soup so that it will satisfy those who prefer mild dishes (including kids) as well as those of us who prefer a bolder spice. The main soup is very straightforward, and on the side, we have a bright and intense orange and jalapeno salsa. You can also pass grated cheddar cheese for those who would prefer to think of it as vegetarian chile.</p>
<p>I find that home-cooked beans are far better than canned. They just seem to have more flavor and a better texture. On the other hand, canned beans sure are convenient if you haven't thought ahead to soak and boil a batch. Just be sure and rinse them well. Alternatively, get a pressure cooker and you can decide to make beans in the late afternoon and still have them beautifully cooked for dinner that night.</p>
<p>There are several ways to puree the soup. Always remove it from the heat first. If you have an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X27HV7X?tag=herb-hugo-20">immersion blender</a>, put it in the pot well below the surface and whiz a little bit at a time. Alternatively, use a potato/bean masher in the pot.</p>
