<em>Potatoes with Crispy Curry Leaves</em>

How is this for confusing? <strong>Curry powder is not made from curry leaves.</strong> Good Indian cooks tend to mix spices for individual dishes, although there are some mixtures that are fairly standardized, like garam masala. In the west, some truly awful, unbalanced spice mixtures go by the name of curry powder and should be roundly avoided. To make matters worse, curry leaves themselves <strong>can </strong>be ground into a powder called karuvepilai podi, although you probably won't run into that so often.

But back to curry leaves. You'll have to find an Indian grocery, or a very well stocked pan-Asian grocery to get them. They do freeze rather well though, so it is ok to buy more than you will use immediately. Curry leaves are <strong>just incredibly aromatic</strong>, in a way that smells something like sesame and nuts. Don't believe anyone that tells you to use bay leaves as a substitute; they aren't even vaguely similar. Plus, curry leaves are edible when crisped up, while bay leaves will choke you.

Here's an easy way to use them, sautéed with potatoes. I kept the other flavors muted so you can really enjoy the curry leaves themselves. I used little, waxy, dark purple potatoes because I figured the <strong>visual contrast</strong> would be beautiful, but any small potato will do just fine.

By the way, when you boil potatoes, you should <strong>always start them in cold water</strong>, as this will give the inside a chance to come up to temperature before the outside overcooks and falls apart.
