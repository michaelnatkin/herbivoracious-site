I'm crazy about mint, though I'm a lot more likely to use it in savory dishes than add it superfluously to a dessert plate. It brings a fresh, slightly surprising element to dishes like <a href="/2010/12/pappardelle-with-eggplant-ragu-and-fresh-ricotta-recipe/" target="_blank">Pappardelle with Eggplant Ragu</a> or these <a href="/2009/04/fava-beans-potatoes-saffron-rice/" target="_blank">Fava Beans with Potatoes and Saffron Rice</a>.

Have you ever wondered how chefs make those neat, even little ribbons from mint (otherwise known as chiffonade)? Watch the quick little video above and I'll show you exactly how it is done, and you'll feel proud when you master a new knife skill.

I'm trying something a little bit different from last week's <a href="/2012/03/dutch-baby-with-sauteed-apples-my-first-video-recipe/" target="_blank">Dutch baby video</a>. That one was hosted on vimeo and today's is on youtube. My hope is that youtube offers a bigger sharing platform. So if you like the video, please do click the YouTube button and share it!
