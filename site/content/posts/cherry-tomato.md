In this case a Sun Gold tomato and a Rainier cherry. I tried to use an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009XBJCG?tag=herb-hugo-20">LM Pectin</a> solution and plastic wrap to create the bond, and it only worked so-so, it wasn&#39;t as seamless or strong as I would have liked. Suggestions welcome.</p><p>The flavor combination was surprisingly apt, though the tomato tended to dominate. Honestly, the idea was purely based on the similar sizes. I wasn&#39;t so sure it would taste good, and it was odd enough that I couldn&#39;t even imagine the flavor very well. The result actually was enlightening - cherries and tomatoes are both tart and sweet, but with very different volatile / olfactory components. I found that tasting both at once emphasized that tomatoes are in fact a fruit. If I could get the bond right, I would definitely serve these as an amuse.</p><p>It would also be fun to do a pair of these, with the second one using dark red varieties of both fruits.</p><p>Also on the plate: lemon basil, dill flowers, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019ZHXQE?tag=herb-hugo-20">Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt) salt</a>.</p>
