<p>This salad takes advantage of the easy and unusual method for Cryo-Pickled Onions on . The onions go right in the salad, and the pickling liquid is used to make the vinaigrette. (You’ll have to make the onions at least a day in advance of when you want to serve the salad). I love how the subtle flavor of fresh ginger works with the pear.</p>
<p>For a more elegant presentation, refrigerate four salad plates and served this as an arranged salad instead of in a family-style bowl.</p>
<p>Buy the best aged gouda you can afford for this salad. The good stuff is at least one year old and has a slightly crystalline texture and prounounced nutty flavor.</p>

<p><strong>Pear and Gouda Salad</strong>
<br /><em>Gluten-free / Serves 4 / 15 minutes if you have the cryo-pickled onions</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 cup Cryo-Pickled Onions + 2 tablespoons of the pickling liquid</li>
<li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
<li>1 head romaine lettuce, mostly hearts, sliced, washed and dried</li>
<li>1/3 cup green pumpkin seeds (pepitas), skillet-toasted if raw</li>
<li>2 ounces aged gouda, thinly sliced (with a cheese plane or vegetable peeler)</li>
<li>1 ripe pear, peeled and sliced into 16 pieces, just before serving so it doesn’t brown</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Whisk together the pickling liquid, olive oil, and salt. It is ok if it doesn’t completely emulsify. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
<li>Put the lettuce, toasted pumpkin seeds, gouda, pear slices and pickled onions in a salad bowl.</li>
<li>Give the dressing one last whisk and dress the salad; start with half of the dressing and add more as needed so that the leaves are nicely coated but not drenched.</li>
</ol>
