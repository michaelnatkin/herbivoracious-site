Serve this with the <a href="/2009/03/coconut-rice-recipe/" target="_blank">Coconut Rice</a> and a salad with a nice lime-based dressing and you are eating well tonight. The idea here is maximum flavor, provided by substantial quantities of lemongrass, ginger and garlic.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t worked with lemongrass before, you need to know how to prepare it. Don&#39;t worry, it is easy, but do it carefully or you can end up with unpleasant woody bits in your stir-fry. Here&#39;s what you do: remove the outer layer of each stem and trim away the bottom 1/4&quot; inch and most of the top, leaving only about a 3&quot; piece that should be tender enough to sink a fingernail into. Now pound it with something heavy to release the flavors. Many cooks use the back edge of their knife, but you&#39;ll have to decide if you feel safe doing that. If not, a can of beans should work fine. Once you&#39;ve given it a good thrashing, finely mince it and you are all set.</p><p>When I work with tofu, I almost always fry it separately so it can get some serious surface area in a hot pan and get a little crust going. Then I give it a little me-time off to the side while the rest of the dish cooks, and add it back at the last minute to come back to temperature. Time-saving tip: start the tofu cooking, then use that time to prepare the other ingredients.</p><p>Oyster mushrooms would be good instead of the green beans in this dish.You could also add a bit of finely diced yellow bell pepper for more color.</p><p>Since I&#39;m vegetarian and don&#39;t cook with fish sauce, I use a little bit of soy sauce to provide a bit of background umami.</p><p><strong>Vietnamese Lemongrass Green Beans and Tofu</strong><br /><em>Serves 4<br />Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free</em></p><ul> <li>1 lb. extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cut into 1/2&quot; cubes</li> <li>1 lb. green beans, stem ends trimmed</li> <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li> <li>3 cloves garlic, minced or crushed</li> <li>1 tablespoon peeled and finely grated fresh ginger (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fgw%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3D%2520microplane%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">microplane</a> is ideal for this)</li> <li>2 stalks of lemongrass (prepared as described above)</li> <li>optional: fresh chili peppers of your choice, minced</li> <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li> <li>salt</li> <li>black pepper</li> </ul> <ol> <li>In a large skillet or wok over maximum heat, fry the tofu in about half of the oil until it is crispy and brown, stirring occasionally.
