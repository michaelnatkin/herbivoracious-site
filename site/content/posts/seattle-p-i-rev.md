<p>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer just published a <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/345921_rest04.html">full review of Cafe Flora</a>. (It will be in the Fri. 1/4/08 print edition). We were all very pleased with the positive comments from reviewer Leslie Kelly. </p>  <p>I'd like to tell you I was just mildly happy about her mention of my own contribution to the menu, the <a href="/2007/12/winter-green-du/">Green Dumplings in Shiitake Broth</a>. But I'd be lying.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;The green dumplings managed to pull off a bit of Italian-Asian fusion, as ricotta-filled won tons floated in a lovely shiitake mushroom broth. A shower of Parmesan and lemon zest provided a dramatic finishing flourish.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Honestly that is more than I could have hoped for as icing on the cake of this great <a href="/2007/10/my-first-week-w/">internship</a> experience. A dish on the menu and a positive review in the paper! Everyone at Cafe Flora has been so fun to work with, generous with their knowledge, and patient with a newcomer, I'm sad that I only have a few weeks left there.</p>
