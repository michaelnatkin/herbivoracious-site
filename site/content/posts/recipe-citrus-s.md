We used a combination of arugula and mache, two very flavorful greens that have the slight bitterness to combine well with the bright citrus fruit. The blood oranges and grapefruit <a href="/2008/01/recipe-grapefru/">supremes</a> looked great, and the sharp <a type="amzn" search="sherry vinegar" category="gourmet food">sherry vinaigrette</a> brought the whole thing together. A few thin slices of red onion seal the deal.</p>  <p>When I use raw onions like this, I like to keep the slices in ice cold water until just before serving. The cold keeps the sulfur compounds from being as volatile, so the onion tastes sweeter. Just drain them well before plating.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
