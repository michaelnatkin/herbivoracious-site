    - "1 rib celery, diced"
    - "3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced"
    - "Pinch crushed red pepper"
    - "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt"
    - "1 bunch mustard green, stems removed and cut into 1\" ribbons"

Things this soup will not do: Win any beauty contests.

Things this soup will do: Warm you to your core on a cold day. Nourish you. Fill your belly. Leave you with an abiding sense of contentment. Wash and fold your clothes.

This is a tradeoff I can live with.

I haven't been completely sold on the farro revolution. I like the flavor, but I find that the chewy texture becomes bothersome after awhile when served as a basic grain side dish or in a risotto-style presentation. I'm digging it in this soup though. It doesn't fall apart in the broth. It makes the soup feel substantial, bordering on a stew that can be a one-pot meal.

The <a title="Organic farro" href="http://chefshop.com/Farro-Emmer-Organic-P6425.aspx?afid=10" target="_blank">farro I used</a> is from my friend Tim's store, ChefShop.com. Click over to that link and read the whole story about how it is grown in Eastern Washington by a family farmer, Lena Lentz Hardt, who was able to jump off the treadmill of industrial crop pricing for commodity wheat by growing this very special, organic grain.

Needless to say, you can vary this soup by switching in a different bean for the chickpeas (cannellini would be very Italian), or a different green for the mustard greens. Any kind of kale would be very appropriate. I probably wouldn't use spinach, as the more delicate texture might not hold up to the farro.
