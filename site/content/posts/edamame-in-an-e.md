I've been cogitating about this idea for awhile. Don't ask me why, but I've really had the urge to use circle cutters to make things out of tofu lately. And then I had this idea that I could make an edible bowl, and it seemed only fitting that I should fill it either with edamame or miso soup. Sort of an Ode To Soy. This one was pretty big, maybe 4 1/2 inches across, but I think it would work well to do much smaller ones and serve them individually as an appetizer. And it is ridiculously easy. Just start with good quality firm or extra firm tofu. Use one large circle cutter to create the outside shape. Brush with oil, set on a heatproof surface, and hit the outside with a blowtorch all the way around. Then use a smaller circle cutter but don't go all the way to the bottom, and hollow out with a spoon. Toss edamame with toasted sesame seeds, sesame oil and sea salt. I used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000K6X8KI?tag=herb-hugo-20">black Hawaiian salt</a>. I plated it with nanami togarashi spice mix, both for color and to provide some heat. The photograph shows way too much of it though, that is pretty spicy stuff so just a light dusting would be more appropriate. (Nanami togarashi is a Japanese pepper mixture that includes chili flakes, orange peel, sesame seeds, ginger, and seaweed. You can find it at Uwajimaya markets or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002YGSA0?tag=herb-hugo-20">online</a>).
