<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Cornmeal Pancakes From Joy of Cooking</span>

Friday night, put in a <a href="/2007/10/my-first-week-w/">good day of work at Cafe Flora</a>. When I got home around 9, Sarina hadn't really eaten dinner and was in the mood for pasta. You know you love to cook when that sounds like good fun! I made her a spicy angel hair pasta with breadcrumbs that comes together in about the time it takes the water to boil (recipe below).

If a friend asks you for an easy and flavorful vegetarian dish, this would be a good one to recommend. You've got the heat of the chili flakes, the pungent garlic, crunch from the breadcrumbs, a little acid from the lemon, and a bit of saltiness. Just don't overcook the pasta.

Then this morning, Mini-Me wanted pancakes, and we decided they should be corn pancakes, from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743246268?tag=herb-hugo-20">Joy of Cooking</a>. Picture above. Yep, I like mine a little burned. She ate almost of 5 of them, and she's only 2.5 years old.

Sometimes it just doesn't need to be any more complicated than these simple, delicious things.

By the way, have you checked the expiration date on your baking powder and baking soda recently?  I recently replaced some that was out of date and boy are things rising better now!

Here's the Angel Hair recipe:
