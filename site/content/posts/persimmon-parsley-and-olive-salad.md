I was casting about for something refreshing and <strong>vaguely Spanish</strong> to serve with this <a href="/2008/12/ilans-top-chef-fideos-vegetarian-style-with-a-review-of-the-top-chef-cookbook/" target="_blank">rich dish of fideos</a>, and hit on the idea of using persimmons in a salad that I usually make with blood oranges later in the winter. </p><p>The two common varieties of persimmon are Fuyus, which are rather squat, and Hachiyas, which are more oblong. Fuyus are eaten crisp, while Hachiyas are <strong>inedibly astringent</strong> until they are as soft as pudding. So for this salad you will only want to use Fuyu persimmons. The flavor is moderately sweet and flowery, with a slight tang and muskiness, somewhat similar to mango. You generally have to peel the fruit unless the skin is surprisingly tender. (By the way, these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078YNXVFT?tag=herb-hugo-20">Zyliss Soft Skin Peeler</a> are incredible for peeling fruit including tomatoes).</p><p>It might seem strange to use parsley as the "lettuce" in a salad, but I think you will like it. It isn't the sort of thing you eat a huge plate of, it is more of an accompaniment to cleanse the palate. You want to throw some fresh mint or basil in there? <strong>No hard feelings</strong>. A little thinly sliced red onion or scallion would be welcome too.</p><div class="recipe-card">
