<p><strong>Red-Wine Braised Cabbage</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (butter is good too if you don’t need vegan)</li>
<li>1 white onion, thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 large leek, white and light green parts only, cut into thin half-moons and thoroughly rinsed</li>
<li>1 smallish red cabbage, cored and thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 ½ cups dry red wine</li>
<li>1 teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
<li>several grinds fresh ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Put the oil in a 4 quart or larger Dutch oven (or other pot with a lid) over medium-high heat. Add the onion and leek and cook for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Add the cabbage, wine, caraway seeds, black pepper, and salt and mix well. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes or so until the cabbage is becoming fairly tender.</li>
<li>Remove the lid and continue cooking until the cabbage is quite tender and the liquid is reduced to just about 1/8” on the bottom of the pot. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding a little more salt if needed. Serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
