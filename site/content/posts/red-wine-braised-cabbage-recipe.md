  name: "Red-Wine Braised Cabbage"
  ingredients:
    - "2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (butter is good too if you don’t need vegan)"
    - "1 white onion, thinly sliced"
    - "1 large leek, white and light green parts only, cut into thin half-moons and thoroughly rinsed"
    - "1 smallish red cabbage, cored and thinly sliced"
    - "1 ½ cups dry red wine"
    - "1 teaspoon caraway seeds"
    - "several grinds fresh ground black pepper"
    - "1 1/2 teaspoons Kosher salt"

    - "Add the cabbage, wine, caraway seeds, black pepper, and salt and mix well. Bring to a simmer, lower the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes or so until the cabbage is becoming fairly tender."
    - "Remove the lid and continue cooking until the cabbage is quite tender and the liquid is reduced to just about 1/8” on the bottom of the pot. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding a little more salt if needed. Serve immediately."
