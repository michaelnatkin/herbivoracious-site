I don't think anyone needs a recipe for these, just use your best olive oil for the caprese and your best balsamic and parmesan for the zucchini and tofu. I really need plain white plates for these to look right. The caprese was inspired by that beautiful tomato, and I realized a good if obvious trick. If you cut the slices parallel to the equator instead of top to bottom, then they aren't marred by the cut where you remove the core.<a href="/images/2007/07/20/cimg1237_edited1.jpg" rel="lightbox"> </a>
