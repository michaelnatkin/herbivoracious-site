No offense to any hippies out there! That&#39;s just what I call this kind of dish, when I throw together some components that don&#39;t really have any particular culinary heritage together, but they taste good in a healthy, satisfying way.</p><p>This dish is a prime example. Quinoa is from South America, tahina is from the Middle East, tofu is from Asia, and green beans are multi-culti. And yet somehow, they play together. I&#39;ve always found quinoa to have an affinity for sesame. I&#39;m not sure why, maybe it is because the flavors of both are mild and nutty, or because the quinoa grains are about the size of sesame seeds. </p><p>Bonus: Quinoa, tofu and sesame are all high protein, nutritionally dense foods. It might be just the power of suggestion, but I always feel good and strong after a meal like this.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t cooked quinoa before, I think you will really enjoy it as a change of pace from rice. There is one critical thing you must know: it needs to be rinsed a couple of times in cold water. The grain has a slightly bitter coating on it (saponins, if you must know). Some boxed quinoa might already have this removed, but I wouldn&#39;t count on it. Once you&#39;ve done that, you can simply simmer it in a pot with a 2:1 ratio of water for about 15-18 minutes. You can also cook it in a rice cooker, again with a 2:1 ratio.</p><p>Tahina sauce is a classic combination of plain tahini with garlic and lemon juice. Once you see how easy it is to make, you&#39;ll want to use it as a dip for pita or vegetables or a condiment for falafel, roasted eggplant or just about any Middle Eastern dish.</p><div class="recipe-card">
<p><strong>Quinoa with Tahina Sauce, Tofu and Green Beans</strong><br />Vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free (at least, most people seem to agree quinoa is gluten-free)<br />Serves 4 as a main dish</p><ul> <li>1.5 cups uncooked quinoa</li> <li>1 cup <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joyva-Roasted-All-Natural-Superfood-Friendly/dp/B000VK484I?tag=herb-hugo-20">sesame tahini</a> (Joyva or Alwadi are good brands; failing that, any Middle Eastern brand; if you use a health-food / natural foods type brand, look for one that specifies toasted, not raw. Raw tahini is yucky IMHO).</li> <li>juice of 1 lemon</li> <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li> <li>1 pound extra firm tofu, cut into 1/2&quot; cubes</li> <li>1 tablespoon canola oil<br /> </li> <li>1 pound green beans, trimmed and washed</li> <li>salt to taste</li> <li>optional: paprika or sumac (the dried spice, not the poison ivy like thing) for garnish</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Rinse the quinoa twice in cold water, draining in a fine-meshed strainer.</li> <li>In a pot or rice cooker, combine the quinoa with 3 cups water. If using a pot, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15-18 minutes until the water is absorbed. If using a rice cooker, simply turn on for the regular white rice cycle. </li> <li>If the tahini is separated in the jar, stir it up. Combine the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt in a mini-food processor or blender. Whiz on high speed until smooth. You will need to add some warm water to get it to sauce consistency, possibly quite a bit. Do not serve mortar paste! Taste and add more salt and lemon juice as needed. Hint: leave the sauce in the machine until serving time, as it has a tendency to thicken more. Give it one last spin and adjust at the last moment.</li> <li>Steam the green beans until crisp-tender, either in the microwave or a steaming basket. Or saute them if you&#39;d rather.</li> <li>Saute the tofu cubes in the oil over high heat, flipping occasionally, until light browned. Drain on a paper towel and season with salt.</li> <li>When the quinoa is done, fluff it and let it rest about 5 minutes with the cover off to get rid of any excess steam.</li> <li>To serve, simply put 1 cup of quinoa on each plate, top with 1/4 of the tofu and 1/4 of the green beans and a healthy splash of the tahina. Garnish with the paprika or sumac for a little color and a hit of spice.</li> </ol>
