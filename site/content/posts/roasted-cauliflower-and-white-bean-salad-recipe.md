We all love that caramelized flavor. And because cauliflower keeps quite well in the refrigerator, it works well with our lifestyle. We don't always know how many times in a given week we're going to get to prepare a full meal.</p>  <p>Simply roasting the cauliflower with olive oil and salt is terrific. But there is no limit to the ways you can dress it up with <strong>minimal additional effort</strong>. The active preparation time is no more than 10 or 15 minutes. Today's version with white beans turns it into a rather hearty salad. </p>  <p><div style="float: left; padding-right: 5px;"><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340128773caedc970c-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340128773caedc970c " style="margin: 0px 5px 2px 0px; width: 180px;" alt="Romanesco" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340128773caedc970c-200wi.jpg" /></a><br><em>You could also use romanesco</em></div>I based the flavors around Etruria's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UA3H2S?ie=UTF8&tag=poeticlicen07-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000UA3H2S">orange-infused olive oil (from ChefShop)</a> with which I've been <strong>completely obsessed</strong> for the past few weeks. If you don't have that, a couple of other options would be to use finely grated orange zest with an unflavored but delicious extra-virgin olive oil, or you could use some of Trader Joe's tasty Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar.</p>  <p>I like to cut a head of cauliflower into quarters, remove some of the core, and then break it up by hand from there. Once you get the hang of it, this technique produces <strong>more attractive, intact, round florets</strong> instead of the flat surfaces from a knife, and is just as fast. Try it and see if you don't agree.</p>  <p><div style="float: right; padding-left: 5px;"><a  href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a8396324970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a8396324970b " style="margin: 0px 0px 2px 5px; width: 200px;" alt="Cauliflower2" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a8396324970b-200wi.jpg" /></a><br><em>Bad picture, good food</em></div> The first version I did of this dish was served hot, omitted the beans, and added homemade breadcrumbs&nbsp; <strong>lots of chili flakes, and fresh mint</strong>. It also tasted great but I took a lousy picture of it! I hate it when that happens.</p>  <p>Other possible elaborations: green olives, raisins and capers <strong>(for a Sicilian spin)</strong>, diced tomatoes, feta cheese, roasted garlic cloves.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
<p><strong>Roasted Cauliflower and White Bean Salad with Orange Olive Oil Dressing</strong><br><em>Serves 4<br>Vegetarian, vegan &amp; gluten free</em></p>  <ul> <li>1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets (see above)</li> <li>2 tablespoons (plain) extra virgin olive oil</li> <li>1 small can white beans, <strong>thoroughly drained and rinsed</strong></li> <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion, sweet white onion, or shallot</li> <li>2 cloves garlic, minced<br> </li> <li>3 tablespoons orange-infused olive oil (or see above for alternatives)</li> <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar (or a nice red wine vinegar, or lemon juice)</li> <li>1/2 teaspoon fresh rosemary, minced</li> <li>1/4 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li> <li>sea salt</li> <li>flat-leaf parsley (minced or not, your choice)</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Preheat oven to 450 F. Toss the cauliflower with the unflavored olive oil and a generous pinch or two of salt. If you like, you can microwave for 5 minutes first to reduce the oven time. Roast until there are many deep brown patches, about 20 minutes or so.</li> <li>Meanwhile, combine the rinsed beans, onion, garlic, orange-infused olive oil, sherry vinegary, rosemary, black pepper and 1 teaspoon of salt. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remember that you want a strong flavor because you will be combining this mixture with the cauliflower.</li> <li>When the cauliflower is done, toss the beans and dressing with it while it is still warm. Allow to cool to room temperature, garnish with parsley, and serve.</li> </ol>
