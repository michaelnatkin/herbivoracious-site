<p>Traditional American Thanksgiving is an interesting meal for vegetarians. On the one hand, obviously pride of place on most families&#39; tables is given to a big roasted turkey. On the other hand, just about everything else (mashed potatoes, stuffing, yams, green beans, cranberry sauce, etc.) is typically vegetarian. So personally, when I&#39;m having Thanksgiving at an omnivorous house, I&#39;m pretty happy to just stuff myself on all those other goodies and try to save room for a slice or three of pumpkin pie.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m making Thanksgiving at my own house though, I&#39;m inclined to want to have an actual vegetarian entree. Here are a few from the archives that I think are festive and hearty enough to fit the bill:</p>

Here are some of my favorites:</p>

<p>I hope this list is helpful! If you need any more suggestions (soups? appetizers? dessert?) or ideas for combinations that will work well with other things you are serving, just add a comment below and I&#39;d be happy to help you brainstorm.&#0160;</p>
