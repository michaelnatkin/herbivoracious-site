recipe:
  name: "Chickpea Cakes"
  yield: "about 16 small cakesVegetarian (vegan if you use an egg-replacer)"
  diet: "Vegan"
  ingredients:
    - "3 cups cooked chickpeas (two 15 oz. cans, drained and rinsed)"
    - "1/2 cup green onions, minced"
    - "5 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "1/4 t. minced rosemary leaves"
    - "3/4 t. salt"
    - "zest of 1 lemon"
    - "juice of 1/2 lemon"
    - "1 egg, lightly beaten"
    - "1/2 cup all-purpose flour"
    - "1/4 cup homemade breadcrumbs"
    - "1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds"
    - "oil for shallow frying"
    - "sea salt (ideally Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt) or fleur de sel) for finishing"
  instructions:
    - "Combine all ingredients in a food processor and buzz until you have a fairly uniform mixture, but before it is completely pureed. We want some texture left. You should be able to form it into a ball that holds its shape. It should be neither crumbly nor a batter. Add liquid or breadcrumbs as necessary to find the right moisture level. If you don't mind tasting raw egg, taste a bit and adjust the seasoning as needed."
    - "Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over a medium-high flame. Take a golf-ball sized piece of dough, press it in your hands into a flattened 3-inch patty and place in the skillet. Repeat with as many as will fit comfortably. Fry on one side until golden brown, about 3 minutes, then flip and brown the other side. Remove to paper towels and finish with a little bit of sea salt."

They are somewhat like a pan-fried falafel, but without the benefit of a deep-fried crust, so we amp up the internal flavoring. Try them with this <a href="/2010/07/tomato-jam-with-rosemary-and-saffron-recipe/" target="_blank">tomato jam</a> for a big flavor combination.</p> <p>The basic recipe is vegetarian. You could use an egg-replacer if you'd like it to be vegan, and gluten-free breadcrumbs and alternative flour if you want it to be gluten-free.</p> <p>I also think it would be good with the ratio of breadcrumbs to flour reversed, for a lighter consistency, but I haven't tried it.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
