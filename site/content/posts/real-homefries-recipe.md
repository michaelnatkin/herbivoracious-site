  name: "Real Homefries"
  ingredients:
    - "¼ cup vegetable oil"
    - "1/2 white onion, 3/8” dice"
    - "1 fresh chile de arbol or other hot pepper, seeded and thinly sliced (optional)"
    - "1 1/2 pounds potatoes, any kind, skin-on, 3/8\" dice"
    - "1 teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "flaky sea salt"
    - "fresh ground black pepper"
  instructions:
    - "Heat your biggest skillet, preferably cast-iron, over a medium-high flame. You want a really big pan to maximize surface area. Add the oil and onion, and the chile if using, and saute for 30 seconds."
    - "Add the potato and salt, and stir to coat with the oil. Distribute into a single layer, or as close as possible. Every 3 minutes or so, flip them with a spatula, trying as much as possible to get uncooked surfaces onto the skillet, and of course maintaining the single layer."
    - "Fry until deep golden brown. Taste and salt as needed. Serve immediately, while hot and crispy, topped with a few flakes of sea salt and fresh ground black pepper."
