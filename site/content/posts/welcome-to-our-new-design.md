<p>If you are a regular reader, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve already noticed that we have a brand new design here at Herbivoracious. I&#39;ve been wanting to freshen it up for awhile, but I&#39;d reached the end of my design skills. My brother <a href="mailto:joelnatkin_design@mac.com" target="_blank">Joel is a graphic / web designer</a> and he agreed to build a new layout for me. I hope you all enjoy it! Please add a comment if you like it better, and/or if you are having any problems with it (font, broken links, renders wrong in your favorite browser, anything like that).</p>
