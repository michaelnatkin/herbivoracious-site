<p><span>This is a salad I made up&nbsp; when a friend invited me to a barbecue with 45 minutes notice. The combination of cucumber and zucchini was a happy accident; if I'd been designing this recipe from scratch it probably would have been only one or the other, but I didn't have enough of either. It is very light and refreshing.<br /></span></p>    <p><span><br /></span></p>        <p><strong>Cucumber, Zucchini &amp; Mint Salad</strong></p> <p class="Serves"><em><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Serves 6 as a side dish<br />Vegetarian, Vegan, and Gluten free<br /></span></em></p>  <p class="Ingredients" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt 1in;">&nbsp;</p>  <p>1 large cucumber (preferably English), peeled, seeded and cubed<br />5 small zucchini, cubed<br />½ medium red onion, sliced very thin<br />a few leaves of fresh mint, bruised and minced<br />2 t. dried or fresh thyme<br /><span>¼ c. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000W2SZS?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000W2SZS">&quot;O&quot; brand California Blood Orange flavored olive oil </a></span><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; or ¼ c. extra virgin olive oil, 1 T orange juice, and 2 t orange zest<br />3 T. mild rice vinegar<br />2 t. kosher salt or more to taste<br />1 t. fresh ground black pepper or to taste<br />&nbsp;<br />Whisk the herbs, liquid ingredients, salt and pepper to make a dressing and toss with the vegetables.<br />&nbsp;               </p>
