If you missed it, the idea is that we invite all the bloggers in the city to visit the same restaurant whenever is convenient for them, and then publish a review on the same day. For this first event, the venue was <a href="http://www.txoribar.com/">Txori</a>, a Basque-style pinxtos (tapas) joint in Belltown.</p>  <p><a href="http://kathycasey.com/blog/2008/04/11/txori-inspired-spanish-bites/">Kathy Casey</a> of Dish D'Lish fame is so &quot;in love with this romantic cuisine&quot; that she was inspired to create her own (awesome sounding) sherry and vodka cocktail with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a> and sugar rim!&nbsp; Very cool that she expanded the concept of a review to doing her own riffs on the flavors.</p>  <p><a href="http://tofuhunter.blogspot.com/2008/04/txori.html">Tofu Hunter</a>, like me, was looking for the vegetarian options, and enjoyed the cauliflower and the chickpeas with spinach. She really made me want to try the Cava Manzana Verde a sparkling wine and apple cocktail &quot;made absolutely alluring with the inclusion of&nbsp; <span class="style1">arbequina olive oil.&quot; How good does that sound? </span> </p>  <p><a href="http://thegastrognome.wordpress.com/2008/04/08/getting-choosy-at-txori/">GatroGnome</a> found &quot;the meal, to me, fulfilled exactly what a tapas place is truly supposed to. We enjoyed a drink, we munched a little, we hung out&quot;. On her recommendation, next time I'm trying the Kalimoxto (&quot;red wine and coke with a hint of orange.&quot;) <br /> </p>  <p><a href="http://adventuresofahungrygirl.blogspot.com/2008/04/txori-belltown.html">Hungry Girl</a> dined solo and fell in love with the octopus. &quot;One bite and I was in a whole different world. It wasn't just tender, it was juicy, like a piece of pork. And flavored with smoky paprika and spicy olive oil.&quot; If I ate tentacles I'd be right there.</p>  <p><a href="http://chtriangle.blogspot.com/2008/04/txori-in-evening.html">SeaDevi</a> of Capitol Hill Triangle experienced more of a mixed bag. She &quot;<span class="style1">loved the atmosphere, the space, the design and vibrancy of this place&quot;, but the &quot;</span><span class="style1">salt cod and the onion tart disappointed&quot; her, and found &quot;</span><span class="style1">the drinks are not as affordable as the eats&quot;.</span><span class="style1">&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><a href="http://blog.sigsiv.com/2008/02/txori-taste-of-basque-in-belltown.html">Sig</a> of Sig and Siv snuck over with some girlfriends awhile back, right after she came home from Spain, so she can &quot;say without doubt that the taste was very authentic!&quot; She has pictures of many of the dishes. Her favorite bite was the pera a la plancha con valdeón - a baguette slice with grilled pear, blue cheese and walnut, which I also enjoyed.</p>  <p>Dawn and Eric of <a href="http://www.wrightangle.com/food/blog/2008/04/09/txoko-at-txori/">Wright Eats</a> had a completely different experience. On Monday nights, Txori has started hosting a family style dinner called Txoko ($45). In addition to a couple of pintxos, they had beet salad, fish soup (&quot;salty&quot;), a suckling pig (&quot;delicious&quot;), a cheese course, and dessert! They &quot;like this type of communal dining event because it’s fun to meet like-minded people and swap Seattle dining tips.&quot;</p>  <p>And finally, from the vegetarian point of view, I was a <a href="/2008/04/restaurant-revi-2/">huge fan</a> of the bocadillo (little sandwich) of potato tortilla (Spanish omelette) on a Columbia City Baker roll, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DYDFVG12?tag=herb-hugo-20">marcona almonds</a> (pictured above). I really enjoyed the opportunity to taste lots of little bites of great food in an informal environment.</p>  <p>Thanks everyone who participated! I think we may have a couple late entries coming in, which I'll add above. If I missed anyone, please email me right away. </p>  <p>Questions to bloggers and readers both: Was this fun? Useful? DId you get different perspectives? Should we do it again? Any suggestions for the next venue?</p>      <p><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/334300/Seattle/Belltown-restaurants/Txori-Bar.html"><img width="200" height="146" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/334300/biglink.gif" alt="Txori Bar in Seattle" /></a><br /> </p>
