By playing with different cuts, you can achieve suprising and pleasing textures. The flavors are so automatically compatible, it is hard to do anything wrong.&#0160;</p><p>This would work great as an appetizer before either a Latin or Asian meal.</p><p>Mixed in with the ruby grapefruit are little cubes of yuzu gelee. On the plate are a few drops of cilantro oil (hard to see), and black salt. The salt contains volcanic charcoal, which will easily run when exposed to water, so I prefer to use it on a dry plate or only at the very last second before serving.</p><p>To cut the avocado this way, first halve it and remove the pit. With the skin still on, lay a half cut side down on your board. Working very carefully so as not to de-digitalize yourself, put one hand on top and use a serrated tomato knife to make a cut parallel to the board. Then remove the skin just from that slice. Rub it right away with a bit of grapefruit juice to avoid browning.</p><p>For the grapefruit, cut supremes and drink all of the juice to fortify yourself. Cut the supremes once lengthwise, then finely dice.</p><p>For proper cilantro oil, blanch and immediately shock a bunch of cilantro to preserve the bright color. Dry thoroughly. Puree with 1/2 cup neutral vegetable oil in a high speed blender and strain thoroughly first through a sieve and then cloth. You can remove any water by freezing. The version in the picture above was made with a half-arsed version of this technique which is why the color is weak.<br /> </p> <p>For the yuzu gelee, whisk together 20 grams of yuzu juice (available at a good Asian grocery), 1 teaspoon of sugar, 0.6 grams of LM pectin (I use Pomona brand), and a tiny pinch of the calcium stuff included in the pectin packet. Bring to a boil in the microwave, and immediately pour into a tiny plastic square mold. Refrigerate until gelled. Dice.</p><p>A little bit of minced red shallot would be good too.</p><br />
