<p>There are three unrelated things I want to talk about today. My challenge as an utterly unprofessional writer: segue between them so that you as innocent reader feel as if they are intimately connected.</p>  <p>Have you ever had Persian (aka Iranian) bakery treats? The Seattle area is home to the delightful Minoo Bakery at 12518 Lake City Way NE. I neglected to bring my camera, but there is a nice picture of some of the sweets at <a href="http://www.nerdseyeview.com/blog/?p=96">Nerd's Eye View</a>. Owners Rashid Ramzani and Ezzat Ghaderi clearly put a lot of love into their pastries. Everything in the case looks neat and precise, and the baking area in back is very clean and well organized, both of which I've found are strong indications of delicious baked goods to come. I had a couple of shortbread-like cookies made from chickpea flour, and a wonderful rolled phyllo and nut item similar to baklava. </p>  <p>Like many desserts from the Middle East and India, the Persian pastries are on the very sweet side, which makes them perfect for enjoying with coffee or tea. And also like many foods from that part of the world, they contain a lot of nuts. Which I dearly love, but Snacky Pants is severely allergic to. Now I don't mean it gives her a tummyache allergic. I mean hit her with the Epipen and off we go to the ER allergic. So we were delighted to learn about <a href="http://selectwisely.com/">Select Wisely</a>. They make laminated, wallet sized cards that describe your specific allergy or other dietary needs in many languages. Need to tell the Finns that you are a vegetarian? Headed to Croatia and lactose intolerant? They've got you covered. And if they don't have one in stock for your particular issue, they'll have it custom made.</p>  <p>And you know, when I'm traveling, I like to get in on local events and celebrations. When I'm hiking the blogosphere, I'm always on the lookout for a good <a href="http://countrykitchenpantry.com/2007/08/13/vegetarian-carnival-5-cool-vegetarian-meals/">carnival</a>. Hey look! Is that our name in lights?</p>  <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/801/Seattle/Lake-City/Minoo-Bakery.html"><img src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/801/biglink.gif" alt="Minoo Bakery in Seattle" width="200" height="146"/></a>
