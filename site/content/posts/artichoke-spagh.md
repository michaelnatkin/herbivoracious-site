I got reasonably close for a first try. This is a pretty simple dish, but requires a bit of prep time for the artichokes, and the technique is a bit different depending on whether you use baby artichokes or larger ones. </p>  <p>To prepare baby artichokes up to around 2 inches wide:</p>  <ol><li>Cut off the top 1/3.</li>  <li>Pull off dark green outer leaves until you get to ones that are yellowish</li>  <li>Trim off the very end of the stem.</li>  <li>Use a vegetable peeler to peel the stem and any coarse stuff at the base.</li>  <li>Slice in half lengthwise.</li>  <li>If there is any hair bit (choke) in the middle, remove it with a spoon (grapefruit spoons work well).</li>  <li>Put in acidulated water (bowl of water with a lemon squeezed into it) to keep from browning.</li></ol>  <p>To prepare larger artichokes:</p>  <ol><li>Remove all leaves.</li>  <li>Trim end of stem.</li>  <li>Use a paring knife to remove all of the coarse stuff around the base of the heart.</li>  <li>Peel the stem and any last bits of thick skin on the heart.</li>  <li>Remove all of hairy choke with a spoon.</li>  <li value="7">Put in acidulated water (bowl of water with a lemon squeezed into it) to keep from browning.</li></ol>  <p>There is a good visual tutorial at cheftalk.com, on the second half of the page. But don't waste the stems, and don't quarter them since, we'll be slicing them thin instead.</p>  <p>Once you have your artichokes trimmed, the rest of the dish goes together quickly. Other flavor ideas that I think would work well are chili flakes, orange zest, or fresh mint (which you would add at the very end).</p>  <p><strong>Spaghetti with Fresh Artichokes ala Pink Door (Spaghetti con Carciofi &quot;Porta Rosa&quot;)</strong><br /><em>Serves 3-4<br />Vegetarian; not vegan or gluten-free</em></p>  <ul><li>16 baby artichokes, 8 medium artichokes, or 4 large artichokes trimmed as described above</li>  <li>1 lb. spaghetti</li>  <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>  <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>  <li>salt</li>  <li>pepper</li>  <li>pecorino romano cheese, grated</li></ul>  <ol><li>Put large pot of salted water on to boil.</li>  <li>Put serving bowls somewhere to warm.</li>  <li>Drain the artichokes, pat dry thoroughly, and slice them about 1/8&quot; thick.</li>  <li>In your largest frying pan over high heat, add a few tablespoons of olive oil and saute the artichokes, tossing frequently. Add a couple teaspoons of salt. They will probably take about 15 minutes to get tender. I like them with just a <em>hint</em> of crunch left and some browning. When they are close to done, add the garlic.</li>  <li>Meanwhile, when the artichokes are beginning to get done, start the pasta boiling.</li>  <li>When the pasta is just about al dente, drain well and return to the pot. Over medium-high heat, add all of the artichokes, a handful of the cheese, and more olive oil. Toss for one minute. </li>  <li>Taste and adjust seasoning, then divide among the serving bowls and top with more olive oil if you like, and more cheese. Serve immediately.</li></ol><br /><br />
