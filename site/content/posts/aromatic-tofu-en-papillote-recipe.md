recipe:
  name: "Aromatic Tofu En Papillote"
  ingredients:
    - "20 ounces firm or extra-firm tofu"
    - "4 pieces of parchment paper or banana leaf, large enough to wrap the tofu and form an envelope"
    - "1/4 cup soy sauce"
    - "1 tablespoon mirin"
    - "1 teaspoon vegetable broth powder (optional)"
    - "1\" piece of fresh ginger, grated"
    - "1 stalk fresh lemongrass, trimmed, pounded and finely minced. (See box on )"
    - "2 jalapeno (optional, or other peppers, heat to your taste), seeded and sliced thin"
    - "2 green onions, white and light green parts only, sliced thin lengthwise"
    - "1/2 orange or yellow bell pepper, cut into ¼” dice"
    - "black pepper"
    - "long pepper (optional, see above)"
    - "1 lime, cut into wedges"
  instructions:
    - "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F."
    - "Cut the tofu into 8 evenly sized slabs, about ½” thick. Score each slice in both directions, being careful not to cut all the way through, with cuts about 1/4\" apart, angled from top to bottom."
    - "Combine the soy sauce, mirin and broth powder with 1/4 cup of water. Place two pieces of tofu on each piece of parchment or banana leaf, and spoon a tablespoon or two of the sauce over each one, gently working it into the score lines."
    - "Evenly divide the ginger, lemongrass, jalapeno, scallions, and bell pepper over the packets. Season each with several grinds of black pepper and long pepper."
    - "Fold the wrapper over first in one direction and then the other, rolling the lip to make a firm seal, moderately tight around the ingredients, but leave a bit of room for steam. Secure with two toothpicks. Place on a baking sheet in the oven and cook for about 20 minutes. If you are using parchment paper, it will turn quite brown, which is normal."
    - "To serve, place each packet on an individual plate. Tell the diners to open it carefully and enjoy the aromatic steam. Pass the lime wedges."

<p>Imagine opening a present at the table, and being greeted with a rush of aromatic steam full of lemongrass and ginger that makes you close your eyes with pleasure.  Baking your food in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H79KX8W?tag=herb-hugo-20">parchment paper</a> or banana leaves is just the ticket to that experience.</p>
<p>Rather than pre-marinating the tofu, for this recipe we score it in both directions to open up lots of surface area for the seasoning to penetrate. This also creates an interesting look, somewhat similar to fish.</p>
<p>One nice thing about making individual packets is that you can customize the spice level for each person if necessary. For children, leave out the jalapeno and long pepper and add their favorite vegetables.</p>
