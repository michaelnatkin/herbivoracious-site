When I came back to them today, I could see several opportunities to improve the recipe. Pre-toasting the sesame seeds, using buttermilk, not buttermilk powder, altering the ratio of cornmeal to all-purpose flour, and upping the salt all contribute to a better structure and more flavor.</p> <p>These muffins aren&#39;t particularly sweet. You can take them in two directions. Offer them up with plenty of room temperature butter and honey for a breakfast treat, or if you want to go savory, serve them instead of <a href="/2009/04/best-cornbread-ever/" target="_blank">cornbread</a> with a big bowl of <a href="/2009/04/vegetarian-chili-recipe/" target="_blank">vegetarian chili</a>.</p> <p>Other things that would be good to add: blueberries, grated ginger, lemon or orange zest.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
