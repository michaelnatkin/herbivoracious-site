<em>Vegetarian Bibimbap</em>

Considering that I've posted a fair number of <a href="/" target="_blank">Korean recipes</a> over the years, it seems odd that I've never written down <strong>my favorite Korean dish of all</strong>: <em>bibimbap</em>. Pronounced "bee-bim-bop", bibimbap is simply a bowl of hot rice with a variety of cooked and raw vegetables. A raw, poached, or fried egg is served on top and kochujang (Korean miso / chili paste) is passed on the side, and the egg yolk together with the kochujang is mixed into the rice before eating.

Bibimbap is one of the few things that vegetarians can usually count on getting at most Korean restaurants. It it typically made with beef, but that is easy to leave off, and there aren't usually any seafood products in it. Sometimes you can order <em>dolsot bibimbap</em>, which is served in a heavy, smoking hot stone bowl. The first time I ever had that was after a day of skiing, and  I could feel the heat from the bowl <strong>radiating right into my chest</strong>. Fantastic. The rice on the bottom gets a little toasted and crispy, too. Well worth the extra dollar. Someday I'm going to buy a set of those bowls so I can make it that way at home.

<strong>Bibimbap isn't so much a dish as a platform.</strong> You can change out the vegetables at will, just keep the flavorings Korean and you won't go wrong. Here's a basic recipe. It isn't measured very precisely because it doesn't need to be. This is a great dish for you to practice trusting your palate and kitchen instincts.

By the way, I actually cooked my "poached" eggs <a href="http://blog.chefsteps.com/2012/12/why-sous-vide-is-the-best-bargain-in-cooking/" target="_blank">sous vide</a> at 63 degrees C for 45 minutes. You don't have to do it this way, but if you have an immersion circulator it is a great option. I find a lot of people aren't completely comfortable with the texture of the white at that temperature, so I generally crack them into boiling water for 10 seconds before removing with a slotted spoon to give a more traditional appearance.
