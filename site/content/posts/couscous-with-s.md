I really do love the Greek God's products. They are a small company based in Seattle, started by three young guys who wanted to bring the true flavors of their Greek heritage to the public, and they have done a great job. </p>  <p>For a quick snack right from the fridge, my favorite is the fig flavor. The plain or non-fat are excellent for cooking. They are thick and flavorful, so no draining is required to make a delicious sauce.</p>  <p>The recipe below is for a very quick parsley-yogurt sauce that you can make in the food processor. The same technique can be used with different fresh herbs, or a combination. Likely candidates would be mint, dill, oregano, marjoram, or scallions. Add grated cucumber (without the seeds), and you are headed into Indian raita territory.</p>  <p>I love this kind of yogurt sauce because you can make it in minutes, and use it to amp up the flavor of any meal. They are especially welcome with spicy foods because the yogurt cuts the heat. The same type of sauce can also work as a salad dressing or even a cold soup.</p>  <p>Last night I used it over couscous with spicy acorn squash, cauliflower, and chickpeas. Oven-roasting the vegetables gives them a light caramelization that adds a lot of flavor, and the spicy harissa rub on the acorn squash gives the dish another dimension. I've separated out the sub-recipes for each of the components to make it easier to do parts ahead, or mix-and-match.</p>  <p><strong>Couscous with Parsley Yogurt Sauce, Spicy Acorn Squash, Roasted Cauliflower and Chickpeas</strong><br /><em>Vegetarian, not gluten free</em><br /><em>To make vegan, use a soy yogurt instead</em><br /><em>Serves 4</em></p>  <p><strong>For the parsley-yogurt sauce:</strong></p>  <ul><li>3 c.
