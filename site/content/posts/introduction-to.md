<p><strong><em></em></strong></p>  <p>Like most of us, my first culinary memories are inextricably linked with my Mom. This may seem an odd place to start in a vegetarian cookbook, but I'll never forget her veal. It was lightly breaded with flour and egg, and pan fried. I couldn't get enough, and I would wolf down my first piece to make sure that I was first in line for seconds. She would fry the veal in Pompeiian brand olive oil, which was a pretty radical experiment for Louisville in the early 80's, and I'll never forget the acrid but fascinating smell of the oil burning in her pan. </p>  <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span>When Mom's cancer took a turn for the worse, during my junior year in high school, she went on a macrobiotic diet that called for her to eat mostly vegetarian. Suddenly our house was colonized by a host of unimagined flavors – brown rice, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ASEUTI?tag=herb-hugo-20">umeboshi plums</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TOETLDA?tag=herb-hugo-20">adzuki beans</a>. As she grew sicker, I tried to help by taking over a lot of the cooking, and my experiments met with mixed reviews. The rice with scallops and cubes of cheese was surprisingly good. The chewy, undercooked <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00A6TKLRC?tag=herb-hugo-20">wheat berries</a> with peas and plums … not so much. <br /><br />My girlfriend at the time (and still one of my dear friends) was a vegetarian. I have to admit that my motivations for cutting out meat entirely included impressing Nicole as well as supporting my Mom and saving the planet! Nicole was a good, adventurous cook and she showed me the basics of making pasta with homemade tomato sauce, enchiladas, etc, and wrote down a few recipes for me on small sheets of graph paper that I still keep tucked into my copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1607747391?tag=herb-hugo-20">Moosewood</a>. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>One of my first encounters with flavors taken to another level was at a small (and long departed) French restaurant named La Boulangerie, on Third Street in Louisville. The restaurant had a café next door where they served wonderful bread. But what really made an impression on me was the salad. Made with perfect, tender leaves and a dressing of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004V7JXFG?tag=herb-hugo-20">walnut oil</a>, wine vinegar, and fresh garlic, it was a far cry from the iceberg and Hidden Valley Ranch that I knew. I'd eat there as often as I could afford, and I knew then that food could be much more than sustenance. </p>    <p><em><span><strong>[... to be continued]</strong></span></em></p>
