There is a nice contrast between the browned, flavorful crust and the juicy interior.</p> <p>These mildly-vinegared mushrooms are versatile and easy. I was serving them with a Mexican meal, so I garnished them with cilantro, but you could just as easily use parsley and include them on a Spanish tapas spread. Change to a red wine vinegar or (a smaller amount) of aged balsamic and you are in Italy.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
