You can see it in the picture at the bottom, next to my 8&quot; chefs knife. It had &quot;ears&quot; but they broke off. The whole thing weighed just over a pound! That's a big <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobster_mushroom">parasitic ascomycete</a>. <strong>A say what?</strong> Well it turns out lobster mushrooms aren't really mushrooms (nor are they lobsters). They are a fungus that grows on a host mushroom, turning them red and rendering the original mushroom unidentifiable. Yum, right?!?</p>  <p>Well, it turns out yes. Yum. My first thought of course was to do something that played on the idea of it being lobster like. But when I fried a test piece, sliced thin and well browned, it was distinctly gamey. I'd like to do a plate with a big lobster mushroom &quot;steak&quot; with possibly a huckleberry chutney that plays off the forest gameyness. </p>  <p>But pressed for time for a quick dinner, I ended up dicing the whole thing, sauteeing it with garlic and thyme and lots of butter, and serving it with spaghetti. The pan was a bit crowded so instead of browning, it developed a softer, sweeter flavor, so I'll give you both options below. You could do something similar with other varieties of wild mushroom, or even a mixture.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
