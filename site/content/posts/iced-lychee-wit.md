Sticking again with the idea that peeled and pitted lychee are kind of fleshy and shellfish-like, I made an Asian-twisted mignonette, which a sauce traditionally served with oysters. It is vinegary, and tastes best very cold, so I served the whole dish on a bed of crushed ice. </p>  <div class="recipe-card">
