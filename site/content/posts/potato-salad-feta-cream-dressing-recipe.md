  name: "Potato Salad with Feta Cream Dressing"
  yield: "6 as a side dish (and doubles easily)"
  ingredients:
    - "3 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes"
    - "2 tablespoons olive oil"
    - "2 tablespoons capers, drained and dried on paper towels"
    - "4 ounces feta cheese plus more for garnish"
    - "3/4 cup heavy cream"
    - "2 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika"
    - "black pepper"
    - "juice of 1/2 lemon"
    - "1/4 cup sour gherkins, finely diced"
    - "2 tablespoons minced fresh dill"
    - "2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano"
    - "1 cup roughly chopped fresh parsley leaves plus more for garnish"
    - "4 green onions, white parts only, thinly sliced"
    - "chive blossoms (optional)"
  instructions:
    - "Bring a large pot of well salted water to a boil, and cook the potatoes until they are just tender but definitely not falling apart. Drain, cool, and halve (or cut into bite-sized pieces)."
    - "In a small frying pan over medium-high heat, fry the capers in the olive oil until crispy and brown. Remove to paper towels."
    - "In a blender or small food processor, whiz the feta cheese, heavy cream, minced garlic, smoked paprika, a few good grinds of black pepper and the lemon juice. Adjust the consistency to something just a little thicker than sour cream, and the flavor to be quite intense - that is a lot of potatoes! Add salt if needed."
    - "Toss the potatoes with the dressing, capers, gherkins, dill, oregano, parsley and green onions. Taste and adjust salt and seasonings as needed. Chill in refrigerator."
    - "To serve, toss again, garnish with additional feta and parsley, and chive blossoms if using (broken into their individual tiny purple flowers)."

I wanted to make a potato salad that wouldn&#39;t be cowering in the corner, afraid of being bullied by the borekas and <a href="/2009/01/boyikos-aka-boyos-de-queso-sephardic-style-cheese-biscuits-the-greatest-snack-with-a-martini-ever-re/" target="_blank">boyikos</a>.</p><p>Rather than a mayonnaise or vinaigrette, I opted for an assertive dressing made from feta cheese beaten with cream, flavored with garlic, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a> (pimenton de la vera) and lemon juice. When you make it, aim for a consistency a little thicker than sour cream, remembering that it will tighten up as it cools.</p><p>For the potatoes, I rummaged through the bin of Yukon Golds looking for all the tiny ones, so I could just cut them in half, which looks nice. If you can&#39;t find small ones, use any waxy potato and just cut them into bite-sized dice.</p><div class="recipe-card">
