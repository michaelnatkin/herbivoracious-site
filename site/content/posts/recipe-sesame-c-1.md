Corn on the cob, corn sautees, tofu corndogs, and of course cornbread and corn muffins. Mini-me and I were plotting some of those muffins the other morning, and the inspiration struck to add sesame seeds. Sesame and corn go great together, emphasizing the earthy flavors in each. We added them to the batter and sprinkled more on top.</p> <p>A couple of notes about ingredients. This recipe, based on one from <a type="amzn">Joy of Cooking</a>, normally calls for buttermilk. I didn&#39;t have any on hand, but I had <a type="amzn">Saco buttermilk powder</a>, which is quite convenient to keep in your refrigerator. I used that according to the package directions - 2 1/2 T. of powdered buttermilk to 2/3 c. of water, but that made the batter a bit thin, so in the recipe below I&#39;ve dropped the water a bit. Add the powder to the dry ingredients and the water to the wet.</p> <p>Sesame seeds are sold either hulled or unhulled, and either toasted or raw. I used hulled, untoasted ones because that is what I had. But any of the choices will work. If you use untoasted ones,&#0160; you might want to give a quick toast to the ones that go in the batter for more flavor. Don&#39;t pretoast the ones for the topping, or they might burn.</p> <p><strong>Recipe: Sesame Corn Muffins</strong><br /><em>Makes 12 muffins<br />Vegetarian, not vegan or gluten-free</em></p> <ul> <li> 1 1/4 c. coarse or medium cornmeal</li> <li>3/4 c. all-purpose flour</li> <li>1/2 c. sesame seeds + more for topping</li> <li>4 T. sugar</li> <li>2 t. baking powder</li> <li>1/2 t. baking soda</li> <li>1/2 t. salt</li> </ul> <ul> <li>2 eggs</li> <li>2/3 c. whole milk</li> <li>2/3 c. buttermilk <strong>OR</strong><br />1/2 c. water and 2 1/2 T. buttermilk powder <strong>OR</strong><br />2/3 c. yogurt</li> <li>3 T. vegetable oil</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Preheat the oven to 425 F. Convection is fine if you have it.</li> <li>Line a 12-muffin pan with paper cups or grease with butter.</li> <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl. If using the buttermilk powder, include it in the dry ingredients. Stir thoroughly</li> <li>Combine the wet ingredients in a second bowl and stir thoroughly.</li> <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and mix just well enough to moisten. It is ok if there are some lumps. Do not overbeat or they will become tough.</li> <li>Sprinkle lots more sesame seeds on top. See the picture above.</li> <li>Divide the batter in the 12 cups, and bake until a toothpick comes out clean. About 20-25 minutes normal, or 15 on convection.</li> </ol> <p>&#0160;</p>
