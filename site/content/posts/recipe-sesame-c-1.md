Corn on the cob, corn sautees, tofu corndogs, and of course cornbread and corn muffins. Mini-me and I were plotting some of those muffins the other morning, and the inspiration struck to add <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HQX3YJG?tag=herb-hugo-20">sesame seeds</a>. Sesame and corn go great together, emphasizing the earthy flavors in each. We added them to the batter and sprinkled more on top.</p> <p>A couple of notes about ingredients. This recipe, based on one from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1501169718?tag=herb-hugo-20">Joy of Cooking</a>, normally calls for buttermilk. I didn&#39;t have any on hand, but I had <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DXM6LYRX?tag=herb-hugo-20">Saco buttermilk powder</a>, which is quite convenient to keep in your refrigerator. I used that according to the package directions - 2 1/2 T. of powdered buttermilk to 2/3 c. of water, but that made the batter a bit thin, so in the recipe below I&#39;ve dropped the water a bit. Add the powder to the dry ingredients and the water to the wet.</p> <p>Sesame seeds are sold either hulled or unhulled, and either toasted or raw. I used hulled, untoasted ones because that is what I had. But any of the choices will work. If you use untoasted ones,&#0160; you might want to give a quick toast to the ones that go in the batter for more flavor. Don&#39;t pretoast the ones for the topping, or they might burn.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
