<p>This West African-style stew, redolent with ginger and black pepper, is great made with tiny eggplants, just a little bigger than a golf ball. You may find them at a farmer’s market in late summer, or at a store that specializes in Thai or Indian ingredients. Otherwise, use a regular globe eggplant and just cut it into bite-sized pieces.</p>
<p>For a richer variation, you can mix ½ cup of unsweetened peanut butter or sunflower butter into the broth, or add ½ cup of shelled, roasted peanuts.</p>
<p>Serve this stew over a bowl of rice for a satisfying one-dish meal.</p>
