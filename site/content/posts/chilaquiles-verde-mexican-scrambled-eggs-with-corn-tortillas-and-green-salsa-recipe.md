</a><em>Chilaquiles Verdes</em>

First: You didn't forget to enter the contest for a <a href="/2012/05/cook-from-the-book-and-win-a-huge-calphalon-set-contest/" target="_blank">full set of Calphalon pots and pans</a>, did you? You have until 12:01 AM PDT on Monday the 4th.

Now, on to today's dish. There are certain kinds of evenings that imply the need for certain kinds of breakfasts the next morning. If you've had one of <strong>those</strong> evenings,  the kind that demands a sizable dose of protein, salt, and a bit of grease the next day, I can commend you no better breakfast than these chilaquiles. Although there are many variations, the basic idea is that we are going to pan-fry some corn tortillas until they are crispy, then scramble some eggs in with them and serve the whole thing in a mess of hot salsa verde.

I like to reserve some of the crisped tortillas before adding the eggs so that there are some crunchy ones and some that have softened. Both are delicious, so why choose?

<a href="/2009/07/spicy-tomatillo-salsa-recipe/" target="_blank">Homemade tomatillo salsa</a> is of course the ideal choice, but don't feel bad if you opt for a good one from a jar. Tomato, instead of tomatillo, based salsas are also delicious, just different.

A lot of the love in chilaquiles is in the garnish, so I've listed a whole bunch of options. Don't feel like you need to use them all, just pick the ones that appeal to you.

<strong><strong></strong>Chilaquiles Verdes - Mexican Scrambled Eggs with Corn Tortillas and Green Salsa</strong>
<em>Gluten Free</em>
<em>Serves 2</em>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup salsa verde or green enchilada sauce</li>
	<li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
	<li>3 corn tortillas</li>
	<li>4 large eggs (preferably organic)</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>Sea salt</li>
	<li>Black pepper</li>
	<li>Optional garnishes: hot sauce (Tapatio!), minced cilantro and white onion, charred scallion, avocado, sour cream, cotija cheese, lime wedges</li>
</ul>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat two serving bowls, and heat the salsa verde in the microwave.</li>
	<li>Place a large, well seasoned or non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil. When it is shimmering, tear each tortilla into 6 wedges and add them to the pan, along with a pinch of salt. Cook, flipping occasionally, until they are quite well browned. Pull out and reserve 6 of the wedges.</li>
	<li>Reduce the heat to low. In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs, 2 tablespoons of water, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and several grinds of black pepper.</li>
	<li>Pour the eggs over the tortillas that are still in the pan, and cook, stirring frequently, until the eggs are as set as you like them. Remove from the heat.</li>
	<li>Put about 1/4 cup of the heated salsa in each bowl. Spoon in half of the egg and tortilla mixture. Pour the remaining salsa over the eggs. Sprinkle on a bit more salt. Add the reserved fried tortillas on top, and finish with some or all of the suggested garnishes (or offer them at the table.)</li>
</ol>
