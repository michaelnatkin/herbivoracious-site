This is one of the dishes I'm working on for my next <a href="/2008/05/dinner-party-1/" target="_blank">"underground" dinner party</a>. <a href="http://cafeflora.com/" target="_blank">Cafe Flora</a> (where I <a href="/cooking-internship/" target="_blank">previously interned</a>) has graciously agreed to host this time. The menu I'm working on will be Spanish, with both traditional and <strong>modern</strong> elements. (If you are interested in attending the dinner on Tue. 1/27, there might be a few spots left; drop me an email at <a href="mailto:herbivoracious@gmail.com">herbivoracious@gmail.com</a>, let me know how many in your party, and I'll be in touch).

Churros and thick hot chocolate are popular throughout Spain and much of Latin America, often as a breakfast treat or street food. They can be made thick or thin, straight or knotted, and from a potato based dough or wheat flour, but they are always extruded and fried like a <strong>doughnut</strong>.

Churro dough is similar in conception to a <strong>choux paste</strong> - you make a hot mixture of flour, butter and water, and then beat eggs into it. I used a recipe from Michelle Bernstein, which worked terrific. Since I had a savory application in mind, I rolled them in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a> (pimenton dulce), cinammon, and salt instead of cinnamon and sugar.

I've had dried morels in my pantry for a bit, and my friend Dan has been challenging me to invent <strong>"s'morels"</strong> - s'mores somehow involving savory marshmallows and morel mushrooms. The snag on that has been a good vegetarian marshmallow recipe, but I still like the concept. Anyhow, that thought must have put me in the mindset to come up with this idea, where the morels make a soup for dipping the savory churros.

I still used some cocoa powder in the soup as well. The combination is pleasing. As in a mole, chocolate used without sugar provides a subtle, earthy, slightly bitter note that marries easily with the mushrooms.

For the final dish, I plan to froth the soup, serve it in a demitasse and use a star-shaped tip for the churros. Here is the recipe for the soup, which would also make a fine first course without the churros. It is rich, so plan on only about 1/2 cup per person.
