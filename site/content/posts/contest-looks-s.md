<p>Yesterday's <a href="/2007/08/caramelized-pea/">Caramelized Pear &quot;Cupcakes&quot; With Blue Cheese Frosting</a> got me thinking that it would be fun to see what other playful stuff folks might make in this genre of food that looks like a sweet but eats like a savory. Let's have a contest! Here are the rules:</p>  <ul><li>Write up your entry and post it on your blog, or if you don't have a blog you can email it to me at the address below. A formal recipe isn't required, we'll settle for a picture and a description. Please link back to this entry in your post.</li>  <li>Email me at <a href="mailto:herbivoracious@gmail.com">herbivoracious@gmail.com</a> with <strong>Savory </strong>in the subject line:<br />- the url of your post<br />- the name of your dish<br />- your name<br />- your geographic location</li>  <li>Also, please put a comment on this post linking to your post so we can all see it sooner!</li>  <li>Deadline is Sunday, September 16th and I hope to post the roundup within a few days after that (depending a bit on how much fun we are having in <a href="/2007/08/where-to-eat-in/">Rome</a>.)</li></ul>  <p>Also, special thanks to <a href="http://www.veggiechic.com">Veggie Chic</a> for hosting the latest <a href="http://www.veggiechic.com/vegetarian-carnival-6-chock-full-of-recipe-goodness/">Carnival!</a></p>
