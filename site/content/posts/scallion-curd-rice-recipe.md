It is typically served at the end of multi-course South Indian meals, but in my context I&#39;m happy to have it as a side dish with some dal, curry and Indian pickles, or even just as a light meal on its own, often using leftover rice.</p> <p>In fact, that is exactly how today&#39;s version came about. I had some leftover short-grain brown rice, not basmati at all. Still, I thought of curd rice but decided to flavor it differently, with a whole lot of scallions (green onions), which I love. It must have been pretty good, I had to arm-wrestle my better half for the last bite!</p> <p>If you do this, or anything, really, with leftover rice that has been refrigerated, it is important to reheat it even if you want ultimately to eat it at room temperature. When rice is refrigerated, the starch goes retrograde, meaning it becomes crystalline and hard and expels water. This is exactly the same process that happens as bread goes stale. Simply reheating to around 200 degrees causes those crystals to soften back up.&#0160;</p> <div class="recipe-card">
