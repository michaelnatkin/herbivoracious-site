These green beans are <strong>perfect for a potluck</strong>; the beans themselves are blanched and shocked and you can then hold them cold a day in advance and dress them close to serving time. They can be cooked traditionally in a big pot, or in a simple sous vide setup if you are so inclined - I've offered both options in the recipe.

I've been on a big <strong>fresh marjoram</strong> kick lately. It is in the same family as oregano, but I think the flavor is more complex and resinous and interesting. It is especially well loved in Greek cuisine and pairs beautifully with feta and olives. If you can't find fresh marjoram, use fresh oregano and/or thyme.

This dish is so simple that the quality of the feta and olives you use will make a big difference; buy the best you can afford. You might also <strong>add a bit of lemon or orange zest</strong> for even more flavor.

Also, you may have noticed that my new recipes have a <strong>shiny Save Recipe button</strong> next to them now. This will let you save recipes into a ZipList recipe box, which you can always get to from ZipList.com or the "Recipe Box" link in the menu at the top of the site. ZipList manages the recipe boxes for a lot of major sites, so I'm excited to offer this service. <strong>My favorite feature</strong> is that you can add recipes right to a shopping list and then have them show up in the app on your phone. I plan to go back and move some of my most popular older recipes into the ZipList format over time. Try it out and let me know how you like it!
