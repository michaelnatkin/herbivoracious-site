recipe:
  name: "Apio (Lemony Celery Root)"
  ingredients:
    - "1 large celery root, peeled, sliced into half-moons generous ¼” thick"
    - "1 carrot, peeled and cut into ¼” circles"
    - "1 tablespoon olive oil"
    - "juice of 2 lemons"
    - "1 teaspoon sugar"
    - "1 teaspoon salt"
  instructions:
    - "Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan. Add enough water to just barely cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, cover and continue to cook for 30 minutes."
    - "Remove the lid and continue cooking until the celery root is completely tender. Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon directly to serving bowl.
