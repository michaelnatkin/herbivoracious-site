I demo'ed this Brussels sprout and apple hash from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558327452?tag=herb-hugo-20">my cookbook</a> on <a href="http://video.kcts9.org/video/2301973547" target="_blank">KCTS</a> recently, and a reader pointed out that the recipe isn't anywhere on the site. So here you go! Although I think of it as a side dish that goes well with mac &amp; cheese or a rustic soup and salad, I’ve also been known to <strong>fry up a plate just for myself</strong>, add a slice of toasted artisanal wheat bread, and call it dinner.

Many variations are possible. You could add <strong>toasted pecans, hazelnuts, or dried cherries</strong>; change the champagne vinegar to apple cider vinegar, sherry vinegar, or orange juice; or even replace the apple with a crisp pear.

<strong>Brussels Sprout and Apple Hash - Recipe</strong>
<em>Gluten-free </em>
<em>Serves 3 to 4 </em>
<em>20 minutes</em>
<ul>
	<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
	<li>Half a medium white onion, finely diced</li>
	<li>Kosher salt</li>
	<li>1 crisp apple, such as a Pink Lady, peeled, cored, and finely diced</li>
	<li>1 pound Brussels sprouts, cleaned, bottoms trimmed, and sliced about 1/4 inch thick (about 4 cups sliced)</li>
	<li>2 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary leaves</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CQQ35PK?tag=herb-hugo-20">champagne vinegar</a></li>
	<li>2 teaspoons honey</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook until beginning to brown, about 4 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add the apple and a pinch of salt. Raise the heat slightly and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apple starts to brown, about 2 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add the Brussels sprouts, a big pinch of salt, the sage, and rosemary, and cook, stirring occasionally, until sprouts are wilted and well browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add the champagne vinegar and honey and toss to coast, scraping any delicious browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Taste and adjust the seasonings; it will likely need more salt, and you may also want to add more honey or vinegar to suit your taste. Serve hot.</li>
</ol>
