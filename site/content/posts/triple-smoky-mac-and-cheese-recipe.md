recipe:
  name: "Triple-Smoky Mac and Cheese"
  yield: "6-8 as a main course"
  ingredients:
    - "1 pound elbow macaroni"
    - "8 tablespoons butter, divided"
    - "1/4 cup all purpose-flour"
    - "4 cups whole milk"
    - "1/2 onion, finely diced"
    - "1 tablespoon smoked paprika"
    - "1 teaspoon fresh rosemary leaves, minced"
    - "1 chipotle pepper (canned in adobo sauce), minced, or 1/4 cup Frontera chipotle sauce"
    - "1 teaspoon dried oregano"
    - "1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (preferably freshly grated)"
    - "8 ounces smoked cheddar (or other smoked cheese), grated"
    - "8 ounces mozzarella (not fresh mozzarella), grated"
    - "1 ½ cups homemade breadcrumbs made with 2 cloves minced garlic added"
    - "salt to taste"
  instructions:
    - "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Boil the macaroni according to package directions, draining when it is just becoming al dente. This will bake more in the oven, so don't overcook it. Drain and toss with 2 tablespoons butter."
    - "Preheat oven to 350 and grease a 9x13” baking dish."
    - "In a medium saucepan, melt 4 more tablespoons of butter over medium-low heat. Sprinkle in the flour and whisk pretty constantly for 3 minutes. Whisk in the milk. Add the onion, smoked paprika, rosemary, chipotle, oregano, and nutmeg. Simmer, whisking occasionally until it begins to thicken."
    - "Gradually whisk in the grated cheeses, stirring each batch to incorporate."
    - "Taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning to your preference. It will probably need a little salt, but maybe not too much depending on the cheeses. Add more spiciness if desired. Remember that the sauce should be pretty intense because it is going to be diluted by a full pound of pasta."
    - "Stir the macaroni into the sauce. Pour the macaroni into the prepared baking dish."
    - "Bake for about 30 minutes, until you can see bubbling around the sides and the breadcrumbs are nicely browned. Let stand for 5-10 minutes (to set) and serve."

<p>This grownup macaroni and cheese was inspired by an incredible oak-smoked cheddar that I found at Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. We reinforce that flavor with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LX21KVW?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a> and chipotle pepper. If you can't get the smoked cheddar, use a regular cheddar and smoked mozzarella instead.</p>
<p>You can also make this macaroni and cheese ahead, and refrigerate it, which makes it very convenient for dinner parties. Just wait to top with the breadcrumbs until the last minute, and allow additional baking time to come up to temperature.</p>
