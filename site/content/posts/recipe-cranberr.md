recipe:
  name: ""
  yield: "about 4 as a main course, or more as part of a meze"
  diet: "Vegan, Vegetarian"
  ingredients:
    - "1.5 c. dry cranberry (borlotti) beans or 3 c. canned beans of your choice"
    - "6 cloves garlic"
    - "juice of 1-2 lemons"
    - "2 T. olive oil plus more for garnish"
    - "salt"
    - "cherry tomatoes, cut in half"
    - "green onions, white parts only, cut in half lengthwise and then 1/4\" pieces"
    - "radishes, sliced thin"
    - "black pepper"
  instructions:
    - "If using dried beans, rinse them, pick over to get rid of any extraneous material, and boil in a large amount of unsalted water until tender. You can also soak them overnight beforehand to reduce the cooking time."
    - "Crush the garlic to a paste in a mortar and pestle with a bit of kosher salt. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, use a garlic press or a knife."
    - "Drain the beans and return them to a saucepan with water to just cover. Bring back to a boil and reduce to a simmer for five minutes."
    - "Add the garlic, the lemon juice, olive oil and 2 t. of salt. Turn off the heat."
    - "With the bottom of a glass, or something else large and flat, carefully crush some of the beans to create a thick broth with about 1/2 the beans remaining semi-whole."
    - "Taste and adjust with more salt and/or lemon juice."
    - "Put the beans in a bowl, and garnish with a good quantity of tasty olive oil, cherry tomatoes, green onions, radishes, and black pepper. Sliced hard-boiled egg is nice too."
    - "Serve with pita bread or other flatbread."

By appearance they reminded me of pinto beans with more spots. I knew they were best known for use in Italian soups. But when I boiled them up and tasted them, the flavor immediately reminded me of dried fava beans. And that got me craving <em>Foul Mudammas</em>. (Which can also be spelled Fool Mudammas, or Ful Medames, or Foul Moudammas, yikes!).</p>  <p>Foul is a dish that originated in Egypt and is eaten all over the Middle East and East Africa. It is most often served for breakfast, with a flatbread. And of course there are many local variations. I've had it with a mix of fava beans and garbanzos (chickpeas), thick as refried beans or thin as a soup, insanely garlicky or totally mild, topped with a hardboiled egg or not, and even served with Italian bread at an Ethiopian restaurant, with lots of sliced chilis.</p>  <p>For American tastes, most people (sadly) wouldn't want this for breakfast but would love it for a healthy, vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free dinner.</p>  <p>Nonetheless, I'm pretty sure cranberry beans are not an authentic choice! I suppose not by definition since &quot;foul&quot; means favas. But the flavor and texture was so close, I thought it would work, and it did to my taste. </p>  <p>For the recipe below, you can of course use canned beans, just skip to step 2. Feel free to switch back to fava beans instead of the borlotti beans.</p>  <p><strong>Cranberry Bean </strong><strong>(aka Borlotti Beans)</strong><strong> <em>&quot;</em><em>Foul Mudammas&quot;</em></strong><div class="recipe-card">
