Ba dum dum. Yeah. Anyhow, <a href="/2007/07/vietnamese-sand/">when I last wrote about Vietnamese sandwiches&nbsp; (banh mi)</a>, it was to tell you where to find them in Seattle. Until last night I'd never made them at home.<br /> </p>  <p>Considering that they retail for under $2, there isn't much reason to make them yourself unless you don't have access to them or you want to vary the ingredients, which was my motivation. I thought I would use the outstanding tofu from <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/thanh-son-tofu-seattle">Thanh Son Tofu</a> on 12th Ave, and add avocado and mint leaves. I picked up the rolls from <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/ae/scr/edb_vd.cfm?c=r&amp;ven=4612&amp;s=nws">Seattle Deli</a>. (Which is also a fine place to have a sandwich, but you have to ask them not use fish sauce if you want a vegetarian one.)<br /> </p>  <p>My Banh Mi turned out decent, but I think it could use more of a bump in flavor next time. Some ideas would be to flavor the mayo intensely with a chili sauce and/or citrus, marinate the tofu, or add some drops of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00514F08C?tag=herb-hugo-20">chili-flavored sesame oil</a>.</p>  <p>For the baguette rolls, you want ones that are about 10&quot; long, seriously crusty on the outside, and fairly soft in the crumb. I believe the Vietnamese ones are made with part rice flour, which would add to the crispy crust, but if you can't find those, the best French baguette you can find will do well.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
