  name: "Potato and Green Bean Salad with Arugula Pesto"
  yield: "4"
  ingredients:
    - "For the vegetables:"
    - "1 pound small, waxy potatoes"
    - "8 ounces green beans, trimmed and halved"
    - "2 tablespoons salt"
    - "For the arugula pesto:"
    - "2 ounces baby arugula, rinsed and dried (about 3 cups of loosely packed leaves)"
    - "3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil"
    - "1 to 2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped (use the larger amount if you are a garlic lover)"
    - "¼ teaspoon salt"
    - "1 ounce grated grana padano cheese (or parmigiano) (about ¼ cup)"
    - "To complete the salad:"
    - "fresh ground black pepper"
    - "optional: ½ cup toasted walnut pieces"
  instructions:
    - "For the vegetables: place the potatoes in a large pot of cold water with 2 tablespoons of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower heat to maintain a vigorous simmer. When the potatoes are fork-tender, remove them to a bowl with a slotted spoon. Add the green beans to the water and boil for 2 ½ minutes. Remove the green beans to a separate bowl. Rinse both vegetables in cold water until cool. Cut the potatoes in half if they are much larger than bite size."
    - "For the pesto: Combine all ingredients in a mini food processor. Process until it forms a fairly smooth paste with some texture left. Alternatively you can use an immersion blender, or a regular blender if you make a double batch. Taste and adjust seasoning."
    - "To complete the salad: Toss the potatoes and green beans with the arugula pesto, several grinds of black pepper, and the walnut pieces if using. Taste and add more salt if needed."

<p>This potato salad will really grab attention on a buffet table. The arugula pesto is a bright emerald green that holds its color much better than basil-based pesto. You should still make the sauce as close to serving time as possible because the fresh flavors begin to dissipate, emphasizing the bitter aspect of the arugula.</p>
<p>It is always best to start potatoes in cold water. That allows the interior a chance to cook before the outside has gone to mush.</p>
