</a><em>Apple Crostata with Breadcrumb Streusel</em>

I love pie as much as the next person, but often I can't be bothered with the decorative aspect of making a nicely crimped edge, latticework, etc. (Where by "can't be bothered" I mean "I'm completely incompetent at".) That's where crostata comes in. It is fussless pie, made on a baking sheet instead of in a pie dish. I've posted about crostata before, so I'll refer you back to the previous recipe as to <a href="/2009/08/rustic-peach-and-nectarine-crostata-recipe/">how to make the dough</a>. We'll do a double batch and it will completely fill a half sheet pan, which makes it nice for brunch for, say, 12 people.

Today's variation is sort of a mashup with this <a href="/2007/10/strudel-from-fo/">amazing strudel</a> I had at Forno Marco Roscioli in Rome. The idea of breadcrumbs in a pastry appealed to me, so for this crostata, I use the crumbs to make a variation of a streusel topping. I wasn't sure it would work out, but I ended up liking the result quite a bit. It is less sweet than a typical pie, making it a nice match for a cup of strong coffee and a plate of scrambled eggs.

I highly recommend these basic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YKGROG/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">Chicago Metallic half-sheet pans</a> (otherwise known as jelly-roll pans). They are heavy-duty, won't warp easily, and are good for a million things in the kitchen. I use them to hold a collection of prep bowls, catch drips in the oven, bake cookies and big batches of brownies, roasting vegetables and so-on. Buy a couple and you'll want to get rid of every other junky sheet pan you've every owned. You might enjoy having <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008T960/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">Silpats (reusable silicone liners)</a> to go on them when you want non-stick.

To make the breadcrumbs, take a few slices of day-old artisan bread, such as pain au levain, and simply whiz them in the blender. You'll probably have to tamp them down a few times. Don't reduce them all the way to powder. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LQETHI/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">Vita-Prep</a> makes extremely short work of this task! Please don't make this crostata using canned breadcrumbs, I'm pretty sure that would be terrible.

<strong>Apple Crostata with Breadcrumb</strong> <div class="recipe-card">
<strong>Streusel</strong>
<em>Serves 12</em>
<em>Vegetarian and kosher </em>
<ul>
	<li>Double batch of the pastry dough from this <a href="/2009/08/rustic-peach-and-nectarine-crostata-recipe/" target="_blank">older crostata recipe</a>, refrigerated</li>
	<li>4 apples (I used Braeburns)</li>
	<li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
	<li>Kosher salt</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (preferably fresh ground)</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
	<li>1/4 cup sugar + 2 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
	<li>2 cups breadcrumbs from artisan bread (I used a slightly stale pain au levain)</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Preheat the oven to 400 F. Take the dough out of the refrigerator, let stand until somewhat pliable, then roll out to a bit larger than your rimmed baking sheet. If desired, line the baking sheet with a silpat or parchment paper. I don't think it will stick without, but I haven't tried it. Press the pastry into the corners and edges. Prick the surface all over with a fork. Place the sheet in the refrigerator to chill while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Peel, core and slice the apples into 24 segments each. (I start with eighths using this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004OCKT/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">great item</a> and then cut each slice into thirds.) Place the apples in a bowl and toss them with the brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, the nutmeg and the cinnamon.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">When the dough is well chilled, arrange the apples in overlapping rows to cover the pastry. Sprinkle on 1/4 cup of white sugar. Bake until the apples are tender, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, toss the breadcrumbs with the melted butter and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Remove the crostata from the oven and distribute the breadcrumbs over the top. Return to the oven and bake until the breadcrumbs are toasted, about 5 more minutes.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Allow to cool, cut into squares and serve.</span></li>
</ol>
