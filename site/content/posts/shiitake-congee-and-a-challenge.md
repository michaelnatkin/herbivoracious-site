</a><em>Shiitake Congee</em>

In the next paragraph, I'm going to use a <strong>potentially scary word</strong>. After all, it is French, and it also might make you think you are going to need expensive new kitchen gear to do it (you won't). Please remain calm, because as you'll see, I need your help.

And that word is: <em>sous vide</em>. <strong>(Fine, it is two words.)</strong> If you aren't familiar with it, in short it literally means cooking food that has been sealed in a vacuum, but in practical terms it means cooking food with precise control of the final internal temperature, usually sealed in a plastic bag in a water bath. In November I started working at <a href="http://chefsteps.com" target="_blank">ChefSteps.com</a>. We've made it our mission to show the world that sous vide isn't just for professional chefs, isn't expensive, and doesn't have to be scary. In fact, it is <a href="http://blog.chefsteps.com/2012/12/why-sous-vide-is-the-best-bargain-in-cooking/" target="_blank">eminently practical</a> for straightforward home cooking - and you can do it without any new equipment at all if you don't mind <a href="http://www.chefsteps.com/courses/accelerated-sous-vide-cooking-course/improvised-sous-vide-cooking-pot-on-a-stove-method" target="_blank">improvising a bit</a>.

Last week on the ChefSteps forums, we started a weekly culinary challenge. It is very much just for fun, <strong>not some super-serious prize thing</strong>. The first challenge, lead by Grant Grilly, was "breakfast for dinner", and I made this shiitake congee that we are about to talk about. This week, Grant is out of town and I've been deputized to lead the challenge. So guess what I picked? Of course! Vegetarian entree, any style you want, but at least one component has to be cooked sous vide.

<strong>Now here is where you come in.</strong> Everyone at ChefSteps and in the ChefSteps community loves them some vegetables, but by and large it is a pretty meat-heavy crowd. We need some Herbivorions.. hmm... Herbivoracions?... you fine folks! We need you to come over and show that us vegetarians and vegetarian sympathizers can throw down in the kitchen a little bit. <a href="http://forum.chefsteps.com/discussion/206/culinary-challenge-2-vegetarian-main-course" target="_blank">Here is the forum post</a> where you can see the "rules", <strong>if you can call them that</strong> - and you'll see that there is already a certain amount of smack-talk going on. So... are you in?

About today's congee: congee is a thin, savory rice porridge that is eaten in one form or another all over Asia, often for breakfast. It is a blank slate that can be topped with just about anything. For this version, I flavored the rice with dried shiitake which has <strong>profound umami intensity</strong>, and topped it with a sous vide poached egg, pan-fried rolls made from tofu skin (yuba), and store-bought Chinese pickled greens.

Cooking it sous vide was mostly an experiment, since you can readily cook congee in a rice cooker or on the stovetop or in a pressure cooker, or I'm sure in a slow cooker. One nice thing about doing it in the bag is that the shiitake aroma stays very clear and present. Also, if I were to test it a few more times and really dial in the amount of water, <strong>it would stay very consistent</strong> and there wouldn't be a need to add any at the end.

<strong>One more intriguing tip:</strong> when I was testing this recipe, the yuba rolls came out nice and crispy. But Grant mentioned a method, which I haven't had time to try yet, that will make them even crispier. Instead of pan-frying, deep fry them, twice or even three times. Like you would for a French fry. First at a lower temperature to remove most of the moisture from the outer layers, then at a higher temperature to crisp up. Sounds amazing to me. If you try it, let me know.
