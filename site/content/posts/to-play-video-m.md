<p><a href="/images/2007/07/11/071107_1302.webp"><img border="0" class="image-full" src="/images/2007/07/11/071107_1302.webp" /></a> </p>  <p>A few months ago I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060793554?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060793554">Raw Food / 100 Recipes To Get The Glow</a> and had a <strong>very </strong>brief moment of fascination, enough to drag out my dehydrator for a couple days before realizing that lasagna made from pasta is way better than lasagna made from thin sliced zucchini, and god knows raw macadamia nut cheese sounds revolting. Anyhow I remember they had a bit of an obsession with coconut water, which I've always liked. (Coconut water is the liquid you get when you open the &quot;eyes&quot; of the coconut and drain it; it is thin and almost clear. Coconut milk is made by pureeing the coconut flesh.) I saw this Harvest Bay Coconut Water at my local co-op and thought it sounded refreshing, but it doesn't taste nearly as good as the fresh thing. I tried two containers of it and both of them had an unpleasant sourness. Not recommended.</p>
