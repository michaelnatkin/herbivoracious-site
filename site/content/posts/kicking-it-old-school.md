<p>I&#39;m going to be traveling on and off for the next few weeks, and probably won&#39;t be able to post as much as usual. I&#39;ve been doing this blog almost two years now, and since there are a lot more regular readers now than back in the day, I thought I might use this time to highlight a few of my favorite posts from the way-back machine. I sure am grateful to all of you for your support and interest!</p><p>To get things started, here are two recipes from early October 2007, both of which have been perennial favorites.</p> <p><a href="/images/2007/10/09/otsunoodles.webp" rel="lightbox"><img alt="Otsu Noodles" border="0" height="302" src="/images/2007-small/10/09/otsunoodles.webp" title="Otsu Noodles" /></a><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><br />Otsu Noodles</span></p><p> These <a href="/2007/10/recipe-otsu-noo/" target="_blank">otsu noodles</a> are a cool and refreshing combination of soba (buckwheat) noodles with a sesame dressing and lots of veggies.</p><p><a href="/images/2007/10/07/mujadara.webp" rel="lightbox"><img alt="Mujadara (Rice, Lentils and Caramelized Onion Pilaf)" border="0" height="302" src="/images/2007-small/10/07/mujadara.webp" title="Mujadara (Rice, Lentils and Caramelized Onion Pilaf)" /></a><br /><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Mujadara</span></p> <p><a href="/2007/10/recipe-mujadara/" target="_blank">Mujadara</a> is a classic Middle Eastern pilaf of rice, lentils and caramelized onions. I make this all the time because it is so nutritious and satisfying. Make a big batch and you can eat it for days. Everyone loves it.</p>
