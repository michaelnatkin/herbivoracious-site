<p>I said I was a vegetarian. I didn't say I wanted a frickin' plate of your mixed side dishes or some sad Sysco Pasta Primavera! This blog is for all of you out there who are passionate about delicious, well prepared, beautifully presented food that just happens not to have been walking about prior to becoming dinner. We'll talk about restaurants, recipes, travel, books, kitchen equipment, or anything else related to great veggie eats.</p>  <p>By the way, here is my Technorati Profile.</p>
