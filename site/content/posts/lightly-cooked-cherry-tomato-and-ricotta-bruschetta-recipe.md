<em>Lightly Cooked Cherry Tomato and Ricotta Bruschetta</em>

This bruschetta is the <strong>epitome of carefree cooking</strong>, made almost entirely by gathering good ingredients. Ripe, organic cherry tomatoes (maybe from your backyard?), ricotta (<a href="/2008/04/calabro-the-b/" target="_blank">Calabro?</a>), a bit of good olive oil, garlic and fresh basil. A nice artisan pain au levain brings chew and flavor to the party.

Generally I would do a bruschetta like this without cooking the tomatoes at all, maybe just tossing them with the other ingredients awhile ahead of time so that they start to marinate a bit. But there is something great about cooking them for just a couple of minutes as well. The tomatoes start to break down into something that is halfway between salad and sauce that is <strong>quite luxurious</strong> with the ricotta.

It is important to cut <strong>thick slices of bread</strong> for bruschetta because that allows you to get nice browned flavors on the exterior while still retaining a chewy interior crumb. If you use thin slices, you'll end up with a dry cracker.

Honestly I didn't write down a recipe for this bruschetta because I didn't particularly plan on sharing this on the blog, but then it was just so tasty I felt compelled! So here is an <strong>approximate recipe</strong>. Use your own cooking sense to adjust it, you can't go wrong.
