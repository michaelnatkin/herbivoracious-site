Wait! If you think you hate beets, don&#39;t surf away yet.</p><p>I love beets. I would eat them on a boat, I would eat them with a goat. I would eat them in the rain, or in the dark or on a train. <br /> </p> <p> If your only experience is with canned beets, you haven&#39;t really ever had beets. I can&#39;t tell you how many people I&#39;ve converted to shameless beet-loving over the years. I&#39;m a certified beet evangelist. (Which makes it legal for me to marry root vegetables in most states).</p><p>Of course today&#39;s dish is really a beet salad, but using some of the complementary flavors often associated with beef tartare. The visual resemblance would be stronger with red beets, but I&#39;m not really trying to mimic a meat dish here, just riffing off of it. I didn&#39;t think it needed a raw egg on top, but I did put rosemary mayo on the toast for a little fattiness. Sieved hardboiled egg would be nice too. I didn&#39;t add anything acidic, but if you want a little citrus juice in there it is ok with me.</p><p>You could serve this as an appetizer, or as a side salad with a grilled entree.</p><p><strong>Golden Beet Tartare (aka. Finely Diced Beet Salad)<br /></strong><em>Vegetarian, vegan if you omit mayo or use a vegan mayo, gluten free if you omit the toast<br />Serves 4</em></p><ul> <li>4 tablespoons mayonnaise</li> <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</li> <li>2 large golden beets (enough to yield 1.5 c. diced)</li> <li>1/4 cup peeled, seeded and finely cucumber</li> <li>1/4 cup finely diced red onion</li> <li>1 tablespoon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074H61RBF?tag=herb-hugo-20">capers</a>, drained</li> <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li> <li>flaky salt (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006FS4TI?tag=herb-hugo-20">Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt)</a>!)</li> <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</li> <li>black pepper</li> <li>4 pieces of thin, toasted or grilled bread cut as you see fit</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Combine the mayo, rosemary and a couple pinches of salt. Do this first so the flavor of the herb has time to develop.</li> <li>Boil the beets whole, in salted water, until tender. Remove the peels and then finely dice until you have 1.5 cups of dice. They should be no larger than 1/8&quot;. The easiest way to do this is slice off all 6 sides until you have a cube, then cut first into uniform slices, then batons (sticks), then dice. You&#39;ll have some extra stuff you can snack on or save for another purpose. If you take your time and do a nice dice, this dish would look really good.</li> <li>Combine the beets, cucumber, onion, capers, olive oil and a teaspoon of salt. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li> <li>To plate, arrange a mound of beets on each of 4 plates, or use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01IO57N0W?tag=herb-hugo-20">ring mold</a>. Top with the chives, black pepper, and a few more flakes of salt.</li> <li>Spread the rosemary mayo on the toast and serve.</li> </ol>
