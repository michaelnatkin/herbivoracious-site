<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Bing Cherries</span>

No, I haven't been watching too many episodes of the Sopranos. These beautiful Bing cherries are from Batch's Best Family Farms. I got them from my friends over at <a href="http://chefshop.com?afid=10">ChefShop.com</a>. Tim Mar &amp; his crew have a knack for tracking down great food.

I've never seen 3 pounds of cherries without a single bad one or blemish in the bunch. Clearly the Batch family takes pride in what they do. They are picked ripe and shipped fast, and would make an incredible gift for someone who doesn't live in a cherry-favored part of the country. Check out their <a href="http://chefshop.com/Cherries-C396.aspx?afid=10">Sweethearts and Lapins</a> among others.
