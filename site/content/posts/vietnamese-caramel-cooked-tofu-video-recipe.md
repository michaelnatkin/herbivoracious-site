Caramel-cooking is a classic Vietnamese method that produces a rich, lacquered sauce. When I sent this recipe out for field testing with blog readers, it got so much great feedback that I knew I wanted to share it with you as a video. 

The key to having it taste complex, not just sweet, is to get the caramel quite dark. When I made the video, I actually stopped a few seconds too soon. You can see when I pour it that it is a little too thin and not quite dark enough. So don't do what I did! 

I love to serve this with <strong>lots</strong> of scallions; the oniony bite balances the sauce beautifully.
