Mostly we just like to eat them out of hand, many pints at a time. While laying in a cherry-induced stupor, red juice drooling like some sort of befruited Dracula, I set to pondering whether I could steal just a few of them to experiment with flavor pairings.</p>  <p>My first thought was to do a cheese course, which then morphed into something that is more of an ambiguous sweet/savory dish, which I find appealing.</p>  <p>The components on the plate are a corn cake made with fine polenta, rosemary, brown sugar, and butter (which reminded me very much of an Indian <a href="http://www.indiasnacks.com/recipe/781/Suji-Halva-(Semolina-Halva).php">Suji Halva</a>), Mt. Townsend Pacific Northwest Camembert, Bing Cherries, a sauce made from cherry juice and <a asin="B0012S5LQ2" type="amzn">Acetoria Sour Cherry Vinegar</a>, and <a href="http://www.volcanoislandhoney.com/honey.htm">white honey</a> from the Big Island of Hawaii. </p>  <p>The white honey is an unusual product, from bees that fertilize rare kiawe trees. It is raw and unfiltered, with a creamy consistency somewhat like softened butter. The flavor is intense but clean and not overly floral. I'm at a loss to give you a comparison. Maybe a bit like an ice wine. </p>  <div class="recipe-card">
