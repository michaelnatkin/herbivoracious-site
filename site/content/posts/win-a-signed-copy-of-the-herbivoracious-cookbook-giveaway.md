I was just thinking, it has been awhile since I've given away a copy of <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">the Herbivoracious cookbook</a>! So here we go. The world's simplest giveaway. Signup for the email list in the box below by Sunday, 7/15/2012 at 11:59 PM and you are automatically entered to win. 

When you join the mailing list, I'll send you three of my all-time most popular recipes, and keep you updated when new recipes are added. Don't forget to check your email and confirm your subscription by clicking on the link in the first message you receive.

If you are already on the email list (thank you!), leave a comment below by the same deadline and you'll be entered as well. 

Update: the contest is over and the winner was Yoon Park. But of course you can still sign up to receive the newsletter!
