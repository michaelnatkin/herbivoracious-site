  name: "Spicy Nori Popcorn Seasoning"
  yield: "enough for many, many servings of popcorn"
  ingredients:
    - "2 sheets nori"
    - "1 dry chili pepper of your choice (morita is nice), seeds and ribs removed"
    - "1/2 teaspoon sea salt (fleur de sel is a good choice)"
  instructions:
    - "Hold a sheet of nori in a pair of tongs and toast lightly over an open medium flame, being careful not to set it on fire or burn your hands. Toast for maybe 20 seconds, moving it around to get the whole sheet. Repeat with the other sheet."
    - "Do the same thing with the chili pepper."
    - "Break up the nori and the chili pepper small enough to put into a spice grinder, add the salt, and whiz for a long time, until it is a completely fine powder. Taste and adjust salt as needed."
    - "Sprinkle liberally on freshly popped corn, tossing to coat."

A good Japanese grocer will sell many such blends, some vegetarian and others not. Making your own opens up a world of possibilities. Grinding the seasoning very finely allows it to adhere to the popcorn. </p><p>This will take you all of 5 minutes, you can pretty much knock it out while the corn finishes popping. After you&#39;ve made it once you&#39;ll be easily able to adjust the salt/umami/heat ratio to your own preference.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
