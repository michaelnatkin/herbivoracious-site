It is about two minutes more work than normal rice, and it is a great change of pace because the rice goes from being the neutral canvas for other components to stealing the show. It uses both <strong>coconut milk</strong> and <strong>unsweetened dried coconut</strong> to give a very intense, flavor and unexpected texture.</p><p>I&#39;ve made this both with jasmine rice for a Thai or Vietnamese meal (see the picture above), or with basmati rice for Indian cuisine.&#0160;</p><p>You could amp the flavor up even further with lime juice, cilantro, unrefined sugar (jaggery) or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MZC7C2?tag=herb-hugo-20">toasted black mustard seeds</a>.</p><div class="recipe-card">
