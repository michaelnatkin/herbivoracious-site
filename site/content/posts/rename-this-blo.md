<p>I've only been doing this blog for a month or so, and I'm not very happy with the name (&quot;The Vegetarian Foodie&quot;). I guess I just don't like the word &quot;foodie&quot;. So I'd like to take the opportunity to rename it while it is still young. I want the new name to reflect my passion for vegetarian food that is prepared with love and attention to detail, whether it is home-style or upscale. My belief is that vegetarian cuisine can be of the same caliber, breadth and depth of flavor, and beauty of presentation as omnivore food. So will you help me pick a new name? Please add a comment below with your suggestions.</p>
