</a><em>Banana, Buttermilk and Brown Sugar Muffins</em>

Bumble downstairs on a Saturday morning. <strong>Brew strong coffee</strong>. Look in fridge. See buttermilk left over from making <a href="/2009/04/best-cornbread-ever/" target="_blank">Brown Butter Cornbread</a>. Sounds like muffins to me.

Usually when I bake with bananas I either mash them or cube them and caramelize for extra flavor, but today I went a different route. If we have bananas that are in danger of getting too brown to eat out of hand, I'll peel and freeze them for use in smoothies or baking. I recently got a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008H4SLV6?tag=herb-hugo-20">Vita-Mix</a> Vita-Prep 3 as a gift, and it really is just about the greatest thing I've ever owned. The damn thing can puree hard-frozen bananas like they were made of room temperature butter. So I thought I'd see how it would turn out if I mixed all the wet ingredients right in the blender. Bueno! The results were tender, with a moist, open crumb. If you don't have a jet-powered blender, you can do the same thing but simply use unfrozen bananas or defrost them in the microwave first.

I also tossed in a bit of fresh ginger for some extra complexity. You can certainly omit that or use 1/4 teaspoon of dried ginger if you prefer a more standard baking flavor.
