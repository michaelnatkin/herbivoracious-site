The most typical preparation for them is <a href="/2008/05/recipe-cranberr/" target="_blank">ful mudammas</a>. For today&#39;s dish, I used them in a warm salad spiked with tamarind and Aleppo peper, two flavors typical of <strong>Syrian cuisine</strong>.</p>  <p><strong>Tamarind</strong> is best known for its use in Southeast Asian dishes, like Indian rasam and sambar. It lends its tart, fruity flavor to some versions of Pad Thai as well. Apparently it is also popular in Syria, where it was no doubt brought via the ancient trade routes. </p><p>Tamarind is the pulp from a seed-pod that grows on a tropical tree of the same name. You can buy the whole pods, or just the pulp and seeds compressed into a brick, or a fully prepared concentrate. The first two forms probably taste a little better but they require a lot of work, hydrating the pulp with boiling water and then forcing it through a sieve to remove strings and seeds. Personally, I use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JSQDT0?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">Tamicon brand</a> of concentrate. <strong>Call me lazy</strong>, but it means a salad like this can come together in ten minutes.</p><p>I served this with a meal of <a href="/2007/10/recipe-mujadara/" target="_blank">mujadara</a>, roasted cauliflower, tahineh sauce (prepared tahini with garlic and olive oil), and pita bread.&#0160; </p><div class="recipe-card">
