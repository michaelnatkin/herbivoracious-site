Most spatulas suck.

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004WGUM/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">This spatula, from LamsonSharp</a>, emphatically <strong>does not suck</strong>.

It has a thin leading edge, so it slips right under your food without mauling it or ruining the crust. It is strong and flexible. It has nice, wide slots that allow oil or sauces to remain behind in the pan. It has a nice curve so your hand doesn't have to go down into your skillet.

By the way, in the trade, this kind of turner is known universally as a "fish spat". Don't let that fool you. It is a pleasure to use every time I slip it under a <a href="/2012/05/how-to-make-tofu-really-freaking-delicious-tofu-101/" target="_blank">square of tofu</a>, <a href="/2008/12/latkes-crispy-for-hannukah/" target="_blank">latke</a> or <a href="/2012/04/kouftikes-de-prasa-sandwiches-recipe/" target="_blank">leek fritter</a>.

The edge is angled, so if you are left handed you want <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006GT586/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">this version</a>.
