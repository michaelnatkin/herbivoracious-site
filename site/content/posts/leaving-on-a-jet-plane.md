I'm thinking that for the next few weeks, I should turn this into one of those blogs where I teach you how to cook a five-course dinner using nothing but the coffee maker and hair dryer in your hotel room. Because I'm going to be in a different hotel pretty much every night! I leave this coming Sunday, April 29th and will be in SF, LA, Austin, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia and New York. A few weeks later, Portland, Chicago and points beyond.

The list below is what I know for sure so far, but I've also heard from Harvard Common Press that there are more events in the works, as well as some media appearances. I'll post everything on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/herbivoracious" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/michaelnatkin" target="_blank">Twitter</a> as soon as I know anything definite, and I'll also keep <a href="/upcoming-events/" target="_blank">my events page</a> updated. If there is any spare time, I'll also try to send out some informal "grabbing a beer, come hang out" tweets.

I hope to meet lots of you! This is gonna be fun!
