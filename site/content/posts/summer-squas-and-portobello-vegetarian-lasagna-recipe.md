My previous <a href="/2008/12/vegetarian-lasagna-recipe-with-spinach-and-ricotta-filling/" target="_blank">spinach and ricotta vegetarian lasagna recipe</a> has consistently been one of the most popular on the site, so I thought I'd share another variation with you. This versions adds layers of thinly sliced summer squash (or zucchini) and portobello (aka portabella, portabello) mushrooms.

<a style="float: right;" href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a550bf00970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a550bf00970b " style="margin: 3px; width: 250px;" title="Summer_Squash" alt="Summer_Squash" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a550bf00970b-pi.jpg" /></a>

The key to making this lasagna great is that both vegetables are thoroughly sauteed first to maximize flavor and minimize any sort of watery outbursts. See the picture at right - maybe I went a bit too far, but you really want to caramelize the surfaces.

When I told my brother I was making this, he asked a very good question: "Are portobellos even relevant anymore?" I knew what he meant. They are one of the most often overused and abused cliches in the vegetarian repertoire, because they are thought to be a good stand-in for meat. I probably don't cook with them more than a couple of times per year, but I think that properly prepared they have a good flavor and texture. I like to lay the caps down flat and slice them on the bias, a trick I learned at <a href="http://">Cafe Flora</a> while making untold hundreds of Wellingtons and French Dips.
