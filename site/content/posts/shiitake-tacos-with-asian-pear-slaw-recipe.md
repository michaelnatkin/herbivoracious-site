recipe:
  name: "Shiitake Tacos with Asian Pear Slaw"
  yield: "8 tacos"
  ingredients:
    - "For the tacos:"
    - "4 jalapeno peppers"
    - "6 cloves garlic (not peeled)"
    - "3 tablespoons vegetable oil"
    - "1 white onion, diced"
    - "1 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed, quartered"
    - "two-thirds of a head of full-sized bok choy, carefully washed and sliced into 1” segments"
    - "1 teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "pinch cinnamon"
    - "½ teaspoon cumin powder"
    - "16 soft corn tortillas"
    - "For the slaw:"
    - "juice of 1 lime"
    - "1 asian pear, peeled"
    - "¼ red onion, thinly sliced"
    - "handful cilantro leaves"
    - "¼ teaspoon Kosher salt"
  instructions:
    - "Place a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium high heat. Without adding any oil, dry-roast the jalapenos and unpeeled garlic cloves for five minutes. Set aside to cool, then remove the stems from the jalapenos. Remove the seeds and ribs if you want a milder dish, then cut into thin slices. Remove the skin from the garlic cloves and roughly chop."
    - "Return the same skillet to high heat. Add the oil, and when it is shimmering, add the white onion. Fry for about 5 minutes until moderately browned. Add the shiitakes and saute for 3 minutes. Add the roasted jalapenos, roasted garlic, bok choy, salt, cinnamon, and cumin. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the leaves of the bok choy have wilted and the stems are mostly tender but still have a bit of a bite. Taste and adjust seasoning."
    - "Put the lime juice in a small bowl. Using a mandoline or a knife, julienne the Asian pear, tossing frequently with the lime juice so that it doesn’t brown. Add the red onion, cilantro and kosher salt."
    - "Wrap the corn tortillas in a lightly moistened towel and microwave until soft and steaming, about 2 minutes. To serve, make 8 stacks of two tortillas each. Top each pair of tortillas with a big spoonful of the shiitakes, and a smaller spoonful of the slaw, and serve immediately."

<p>I love to make up taco combinations using a substantial component like shiitake mushrooms, contrasted with a bright fresh slaw. Serve these up with big plates of refried beans, Mexican rice (or the Non-Traditional Arroz Verde on ), and homemade guacamole for a feast that is only a bit more work than ordinary “taco night”, but a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>The technique of dry-roasting the jalapeno peppers and garlic for these tacos is very typical in Mexican cuisine. It is a quick way of both mellowing and concentrating the flavors. I highly recommend wearing disposable rubber gloves when seeding and chopping the jalapenos, to avoid the risk of having your hands burn later.</p>
<p>The bok choy in this recipe is the full-grown vegetable, usually about 10-12” long, with dark green leaves, not baby bok choy.</p>
<p>You can take this same Asian pear slaw and use it as a condiment for other dishes. Add a little <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005WXMPMQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">toasted sesame oil</a> if you are using it in an Asian meal.</p>
