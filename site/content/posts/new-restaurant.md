<p>Naomi over at <a href="http://thegastrognome.wordpress.com">Gastrognome</a> has kindly volunteered to host <a href="http://thegastrognome.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/restaurant-review-360-jasmine-and-the-first-sfba/">the next Restaurant Review 360</a>. (What's a <a href="/2008/04/review-360-roun/">Restaurant Review 360</a>?). Her choice is excellent: Jasmine Provincial Vietnamese Cuisine. It has been on my list to try, and I'm looking forward to reviewing it along with her and my fellow bloggers. Deadline is May 20th, so if you write about food in Seattle, be sure and participate!</p>  <p>And, wow, Naomi told me in her email that there would be a surprise. The &quot;360&quot; concept has won me the inaugural <strong>SFBA</strong> (Seattle Food Blogger Award). I'd just like to thank my wife, my daughter, my 5th grade teacher (Mr. Peake), and of course the members of the Academy. No, seriously, thanks Naomi!</p>
