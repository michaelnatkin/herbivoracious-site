Gorditas: thick, delicious homemade corn tortillas that are shallow fried then split and topped with whatever moves you. Close cousins to the arepa and the pupusa.

I'm not going to kid you, gorditas are a bit of a project. You have to make and shape the dough, then toast them on a dry skillet first, then fry them in a good bit of oil. This isn't a weeknight meal unless you are some sort of superhero. But they make a fun weekend dinner, and if you have kids around you can get them involved in shaping the dough.

I based my dough recipe on one from Rick Bayless' classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061373265/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">Authentic Mexican</a>, but I omitted the wheat flour he calls for. I don't know why, I just felt moved to leave it out so I did. Possibly the gluten from it would give you puffier gorditas, so I'll try that next time.

You could of course use the roasted mushrooms here in something simpler, say tacos. We quarter them, keeping fairly large, toothsome bites, and oven roast to develop some flavor and get rid of excess water. Then the mushrooms are finished with a spiced tomato-paste mixture to create a bit of sauce.
