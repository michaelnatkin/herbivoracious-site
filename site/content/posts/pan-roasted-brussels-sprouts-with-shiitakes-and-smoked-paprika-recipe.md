<em>Pan Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Shiitakes and Smoked Paprika</em>

Brussels sprouts are oddly fashionable these past couple of years. They have two things going for them:
<ol>
	<li>Underdog status. A lot of people hated them because they were boiled to death for much of the 20th century.</li>
	<li>But they are actually delicious when prepared well.</li>
</ol>
Now we've caught on that they are wonderful when pan-fried, deep-fried, broiled, roasted or otherwise subjected to high heat for shorter periods of time. (Of course, I actually still love them steamed or boiled and served with good sweet butter as long you don't overcook them.)

I think you'll enjoy this version, which has just 7 ingredients, of which 5 are pantry staples. It comes together in only 10 or 15 minutes. The shiitakes and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> add to the earthy complexity of the nearly-charred sprouts

Wait a second, you don't consider <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003QI7QDM?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">smoked paprika</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019ZHXQE?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt) salt</a> to be pantry staples? Ok, you need to change that. Those are two ingredients that will change your life as a cook. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> takes any dish and makes it taste like it was cooked over an open wood fire, and the Maldon adds a magnificent flaky saline crunch that is ideal for a finishing touch. It takes many dishes from good to great. Trust me, even if they seem a bit overpriced, a little goes a long way and your food will improve dramatically. If you use Amazon Prime, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001XVW3DC?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">2-pack of Maldon</a> is a better deal.

<strong>Pan Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Shiitakes and Smoked Paprika
</strong><em>Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and kosher
</em><em>Serves 2-3 as a side dish</em>
<ul>
	<li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
	<li>6 fresh shiitake mushroom caps, sliced about 1/8" thick</li>
	<li>Kosher salt</li>
	<li>3 cups brussels sprouts, trimmed and quartered (about 9 ounces / 250 grams)</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a></li>
	<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
	<li>Flaky salt such as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00017028M?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt)</a></li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Line a plate with paper towels. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil, and when it shimmers, add the mushrooms caps in a single layer. Cook until well browned on one side, about one minute, then flip and cook the other side. When the second side is browned, remove with a slotted spatula to the paper towels, leaving as much oil behind as possible. Season with a sprinkle of Kosher salt.</li>
	<li>With the skillet still on medium high heat, add the brussels sprouts and toss to coat with oil, adding a bit more oil if needed. Cook, turning occasionally, until tender and many surface have dark brown spots. I like mine almost charred.</li>
	<li>Add the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a>, 1/2 teaspoon of Kosher salt and the reserved shiitakes. Toss, then taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer to a serving platter, finish with black pepper and a few grains of flaky salt and serve.</li>
</ol>
