  name: "Spicy Corn and Potato Stew"
  yield: "4"
  ingredients:
    - "4 cups corn kernels, shaved from cobs and reserve cobs"
    - "3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided"
    - "4 cups diced waxy potatoes (approximately 3/8” cubes)"
    - "6 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "¼ cup minced shallots"
    - "2 tablespoons New Mexico chili powder (or see substitutions above)"
    - "1 teaspoon cumin powder"
    - "2 tablespoons dried Mexican oregano (if substituting European oregano, reduce by half)"
    - "pinch of cinnamon"
    - "1 teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "2 limes (divided)"
    - "handful of cilantro leaves"
  instructions:
    - "(Optional) Put the corn cobs in a pot with enough water to cover, bring to a boil, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove corn cobs and strain the resulting lightly flavored broth."
    - "In a 3-quart or larger pot, heat half of the vegetable oil over a medium-high flame. Cook the corn, stirring occasionally, allowing it to blister and darken in spots, about 5 minutes."
    - "Set the corn aside, and add the potatoes and the remaining oil to the pan. Lower the heat to medium. Cook, stirring occasionally until they are almost tender. Add the garlic, shallots, chile powder, cumin powder, oregano, cinnamon, salt, and the juice of 1 lime and cook for about 2 more minutes, until very fragrant."
    - "Add the corn back to the pot, along with 2 ½ cups of the corncob broth or water. Add more broth if you prefer it a little soupier. Bring to a simmer. Taste and adjust seasonings, adding more salt, chile heat or lime juice if you see fit. Cook for a few more minutes for the flavors to meld and the potatoes to be fully tender but not falling apart."
    - "To finish, divide among 4 bowls and squeeze the remaining lime over them. Garnish with cilantro and serve immediately."

<p>If your New England corn chowder packed up and moved to New Mexico, it might turn into this spicy (but not too hot) stew. Plenty of garlic, chili powder, oregano and lime juice make this irresistible.</p>
<p>The recipe calls for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09RQHNJ19?tag=herb-hugo-20">New Mexico chile powder</a>, which is a specific variety of pepper. I find that these individual spices have much more character than the generic chili powder mixtures. They are relatively easy to find at any grocery that has a supply of Mexican ingredients. Pick up the Mexican oregano while you are there too; it has a sweeter, more resinous flavor than the familiar European oreganos. In a pinch, you can use any kind of chili powder that you have available, or grind dried chiles of your choosing.</p>
<p>I like to make a broth with the corncobs, but if you are pressed for time, you can also just use water.</p>
