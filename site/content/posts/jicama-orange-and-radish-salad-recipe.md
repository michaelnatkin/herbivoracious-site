It offers a nice contrast, makes the meal a little lighter, and cuts the fattiness of the main dish. Here is a simple version, dressed only with fresh orange jucie, that goes great with Mexican and other Latin-American meals. You can work on it while your entree finishes cooking, or it is a great task to give to a friendly volunteer. Don&#39;t forget to pass them a cerveza!</p><p>If you haven&#39;t had jicama (pronounced hee-come-uh) before, you are in for a treat. The texture is crisp like an apple and a little sweet. I believe there are uses for it cooked, but I&#39;ve only used them for salads. They are surprisingly easy to find in the specialty section of fairly average grocery stores, and of course you can find them at Mexican markets.</p><div class="recipe-card">
