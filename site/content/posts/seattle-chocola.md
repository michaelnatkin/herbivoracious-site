<p>Just a quick note to say that I'll be on the tasting panel at TasteTV's first annual <a href="http://www.seattlechocolatesalon.com/">Seattle Chocolate Salon</a>. It is Sunday, July 13th at the Bell Harbor Convention Center, on the waterfront. I imagine it will be a fun event. There are certainly some great chocolatiers coming to town. I'll be there at least from 2:00 - 4:00 PM (unless our baby comes early), so by all means come by and say hi!</p>
