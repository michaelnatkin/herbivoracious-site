<p>Have you ever wondered what the difference between crostini and bruschetta is? A crostini is generally a hard, crispy toast, while bruschetta is rustic bread that has been brushed with olive oil and grilled.</p>
<p>When I make the Tomato Confit on , I like to throw a couple of heads of garlic in for the first part of the roasting. See below for how to do it.</p>
<p>The mint adds an unexpected twist to this topping, but feel free to switch it to oregano, basil, or parsley if you prefer. A few chopped black olives can be added as well.</p>
