<p>Have you ever wondered what the difference between crostini and bruschetta is? A crostini is generally a hard, crispy toast, while bruschetta is rustic bread that has been brushed with olive oil and grilled.</p>
<p>When I make the Tomato Confit on , I like to throw a couple of heads of garlic in for the first part of the roasting. See below for how to do it.</p>
<p>The mint adds an unexpected twist to this topping, but feel free to switch it to oregano, basil, or parsley if you prefer. A few chopped black olives can be added as well.</p>

<p><strong>Tomato Confit and Roasted Garlic Bruschetta</strong>
<br /><em>Vegan / Serves 4 / 10 minute if you already have tomato confit and roasted garlic</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 head garlic</li>
<li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>8 tomato confit halves, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon finely sliced fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
<li>4 thick slices rustic bread</li>
<li>flaky sea salt</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Cut off the top ¼” of the head of garlic. Rub with a little olive oil and wrap in tin foil. Roast for about 45 minutes at 300 degrees until the garlic is completely soft and can be squeezed right out of the skin.</li>
<li>Remove all of the garlic cloves from the skin and finely chop them. Mix with the tomato confit, mint and Kosher salt.</li>
<li>Heat a grill or a grill pan to medium high (or use a toaster oven as a last resort). Brush the bread generously on one side with extra-virgin olive oil. Toast until well browned and nice grill marks have formed.</li>
<li>Divide the topping among the four pieces of bread, season with a few flakes of sea salt and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
