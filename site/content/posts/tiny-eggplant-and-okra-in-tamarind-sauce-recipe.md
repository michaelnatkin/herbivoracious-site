I ended up rubbing them with spices and roasting, then serving them in a <strong>sweet-tart tamarind curry</strong>. Later I realized that I'd made a little joke - they were kind of a spin on <a href="http://rasamalaysia.com/thai-recipe-son-in-law-eggs/" target="_blank">Son-In-Law Eggs</a>, only with egg-sized eggplants.</p>  <p>Although I didn't fill the eggplants, I was also inspired by Healthy and Gourmet's <a href="http://healthyandgourmet.blogspot.com/2009/09/stuffed-eggplant.html" target="_blank">Stuffed Baby Eggplant</a>. I liked the way Natasha had cut them in quarters but left the stem attached. It turns out to be fun to eat most of the eggplant with a fork and then pick up the stem and sort of <strong>suck out the last bit of goodness</strong>.</p>  <p>The recipe calls for kaffir lime leaves, which aren't always easy to source. Try a well stocked Asian or Indian grocery. If you haven't had them, they produce an amazingly floral citrus scent. There really is no substitute, but a little lime zest is as close as you can come.</p>  <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a7b01d0c970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img  alt="Tamarind_Eggplant" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a7b01d0c970b " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a7b01d0c970b-500wi.jpg" /></a><br><em>Tiny Eggplant and Okra in Tamarind Sauce<br></em></p>  <p>If you are <strong>okra-negative</strong>, you could just leave them out of this dish. Are you okra-positive like me? I don't even mind if they are a little slimy.</p>  <p><strong>Toasted and crushed peanuts</strong> on top would be perfect. </p>  <p>I was thinking of this more as an Indian dish, so I served it with saffron basmati rice, raita, papadum and <strong>lime pickle</strong>. But you could also omit the tomato and go in a Thai or Malaysian direction with jasmine or sticky rice.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
