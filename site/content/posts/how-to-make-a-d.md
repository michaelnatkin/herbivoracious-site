Two crazy kids meant I had about 5 minutes to put something together, but I wasn't about to settle for bland. Last year I <a href="/2007/08/block-party-emp/">brought empanadas</a>, so we have a reputation to uphold! Easy potluck recipes are a dime a dozen, but the challenge here was to deliver one with big flavors.<br /> </p>  <p>I raided the pantry and refrigerator and made this chickpea-based salad with a Mediterranean approach. I think it went over well, since it was all gone quickly. As you toss it, the crumbled feta dissolves a little bit and makes a creamy dressing.</p>  <p>This recipe really shows why it is such a good idea to keep your pantry stocked with things like cans of chickpeas, roasted peppers, and good olive oil. When you don't have time to do much cooking, you can still get something great on the table. Or in this case, on the street.</p>  <p>You could easily add or substitute other herbs (tarragon or dill would be nice), olives, green beans, artichoke hearts, or just about any vegetable.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
