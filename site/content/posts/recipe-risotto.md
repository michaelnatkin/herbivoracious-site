  name: "Risotto Cakes With Sherry Gastrique"
  yield: "4 cakes (a light lunch for two, or the basis of a larger meal)Vegetarian, not vegan"
  ingredients:
    - "1 c. sherry vinegar"
    - "1/3 c. sugar"
    - "1.5 c. creamy leftover risotto, cool"
    - "1 or 2 eggs, beaten"
    - "1 t. kosher salt"
    - "1/2 t. cayenne pepper (or more to taste - make it fairly spicy to offset the sweetness of the gastrique)"
    - "small amount of oil for frying cakes"
    - "4 small sage leaves"
    - "Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt) salt or other finishing salt"
    - "black pepper"
  instructions:
    - "Combine the vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt in your smallest pot and bring to a simmer over a low heat. Reduce until it will coat a spoon and turn off heat."
    - "Meanwhile combine the leftover risotto, eggs, teaspoon of salt, and cayenne."
    - "Heat up a griddle or skillet like you would pancakes, and lightly grease."
    - "Put about 1/3 c. of batter on the griddle and quickly shape into a patty about 1/2\" thick. Repeat with the remaining batter. If you want, you could press some panko or sesame seeds into the uper side before flipping."
    - "Fry until quite brown on the first side, cautiously flip, and cook until finished. They taste better the darker you can get them without burning."
    - "Throw the sage leaves in a bit of the oil off at the edge of the pan and crisp them up."
    - "Serve 2 cakes with a couple sage leaves, finishing salt, fresh ground pepper, and a tablespoon or so of the gastrique."

I'm kind of a sucker for any sort of savory pancake, and these have that creamy risotto goodness that is easy to love.</p>  <p>You don't need a precise recipe; all I do is add a beaten egg or two until they seem bound enough to hold together, along with any additional flavors I might want. Then I pan fry them and maybe make a quick sauce, or just serve with a bit of good yogurt or creme fraiche. </p>  <p>This time I made a sherry gastrique. A gastrique is just a reduction of a vinegar or wine with some type of sugar, and often a fruit. I omitted the fruit this time, I and just used a good sherry vinegar and white sugar. You cook it over a moderate flame so that the sugar caramelizes. The result should have an intensity of sweetness and acid so that it only takes a small amount to add an intense counterpoint to a dish.</p>  <p>Here's a basic recipe for the whole dish to get you started, but be sure and improvise!</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
