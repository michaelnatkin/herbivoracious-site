I read them and used them until they fell completely apart, and in the process learned a basic sense of comfort with baking, knife skills and improvisational cooking that has never left me.</p>  <p>Just a few years later, having had a great experience living in a cooperative house, I took a year off from school and landed at the Green Gulch Farm in Marin County. (Yes, I was a big hippie, you wanna make something of it?) </p>  <p>Green Gulch is part of the San Francisco Zen Center and a sister facility to Tassajara. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014BQR74?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">Edward Espe Brown</a>, a zen monk and the author of those books, would make an occasional appearance at Green Gulch and leave behind a kitchen smelling so good from his breads that it would be hard to concentrate on meditation. Oh wait, that was always hard.</p>  <p>Anyway, I was pretty excited to hear that Brown has written a new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1590306724?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">The Complete Tassajara Cookbook</a>. Shambhala Press is also reissuing the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1590307046?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">The Tassajara Bread Book</a>. They&#39;ve given me a copy of each to give away to my fearless readers.</p>  <p>As long as I&#39;m going to do a contest, I want to have some fun with it! If you&#39;d like to win one of the books, add a comment below and tell us, in just a few sentences, the worst plate of food you&#39;ve ever made. Next Monday (10/12/2009( I&#39;ll read them all, pick the worst two and give away the cookbooks.</p>  <p>I guess it is only fair if I tell my own. In my first few months of cooking, my Dad, brother and I were staying at a cabin. I made them a pot of wheat berries, peas, and plums. Cooked plums, yes. The wheat berries never softened. No seasoning. Chewy, inedible wheat berries, peas, and plums. Shoot me now.</p>  <p>So lay it on me.</p><p><strong>Update, 10/12/2009 - We have winners!</strong></p><p>The contest is over, and we had a bunch of hilarious and frightening entries. I highly recommend reading through the comments below if you could use a laugh. It was hard to pick the winners, but I settled on the ones from <a href="/2009/10/complete-tassajara-cookbook-tassajara-bread-book.html#comment-6a00e008d618bb88340120a61f6515970c" target="_blank">Tofu Mom</a> and <a href="/2009/10/complete-tassajara-cookbook-tassajara-bread-book.html#comment-6a00e008d618bb88340120a5cc3795970b" target="_blank">Virginia</a>. Coincidentally, they both involved artificial lemonade where it never, ever belonged! Thanks to everyone who entered.</p>
