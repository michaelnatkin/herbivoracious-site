<p>When I started this blog, the impulse to create it THAT VERY MOMENT superseded the fact that I wasn't really happy with the name The Vegetarian Foodie. Many of you offered great <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;client=pub-2891896769585945&amp;sigafs=ZpdPZHHp9nxbTWhO&amp;flav=0000&amp;ct=cres&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvegfoodie.typepad.com%2Fvegfoodie%2F2007%2F08%2Frename-this-blo.html&amp;ei=icDPRsijMqaMgwP24YikCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGNCejEbckTsLg6UKoal3SZFo4sBw">suggestions</a> and I bent the ears of everyone around me. My friend MG suggested <strong>Herbivoracious</strong> and the more I sat with it, the more I felt it really captured my attitude towards vegetarian food. I don't want to eat animals, and I do have a voracious appetite, not so much in sheer quantity but in the desire to try everything I can, learn everything I can, cook everything as well as I can, and share great meals with people I love. So Herbivoracious is the new name and I hope everyone likes it!</p>
