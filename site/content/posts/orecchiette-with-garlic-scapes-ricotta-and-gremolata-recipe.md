</a><em>Orecchiette with Garlic Scapes, Ricotta, and Gremolata</em>

Unlike tender <a href="/2012/06/green-garlic-and-mint-potato-salad-recipe/" target="_blank">green garlic</a>, garlic scapes are the firmer central flowering stem of the garlic plant. When fully cooked, they have a texture similar to asparagus, and a <strong>sweet flavor like slow-roasted garlic</strong>. In the past I've made the mistake of not trimming off enough of the hardest part and/or not cooking them fully, and then they can be unpleasantly woody, but when cooked until tender they are quite delicious. The most likely place to find garlic scapes is at a farmer's market, though I have seen them at Asian groceries and Whole Foods as well.

The idea for this pasta is a riff on a terrific ravioli that Mike Easton served at Seattle's <a href="http://ilcorvopasta.com/" target="_blank">Il Corvo</a>, a lunchtime-only pasta restaurant that lives inside Procopio Gelateria behind Pike Place Market. His fresh pasta is outstanding, but I didn't have time for that project today, so I made this variation using a good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00060O7H6?tag=herb-hugo-20">dried orecchiette</a>. I'm inspired by his ability to create an <strong>atypical restaurant-within-a-restaurant</strong>, as I want to do something equally non-standard.

Gremolata refers to a mixture of minced lemon zest, parsley and raw garlic that most famously garnishes osso buco. I like it on many things, including these <strong><a href="/2011/02/crispy-garlicky-smashed-potatoes-with-gremolata-recipe/" target="_blank">smashed potatoes</a></strong>. For today's dish, I added a few tarragon leaves for some extra complexity.

The quality of ricotta varies widely; if you don't know of an excellent local source, the national brand you want is <a href="/2008/04/calabro-the-b/">Calabro</a>.

<strong>Orecchiette with Garlic Scapes, Ricotta, and Gremolata
</strong><em>Vegetarian and kosher</em>
<em> Serves 4</em>

<em>For the gremolata:</em>
<ul>
	<li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
	<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1 packed handful of washed and dried parsley leaves, minced</li>
	<li>A few leaves of tarragon (optional), minced</li>
</ul>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Pile these ingredients together on the chopping board, and give them an additional mincing and tossing together. Set aside in a bowl.</li>
</ol>
<div><em>For the pasta:</em></div>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>1 pound garlic scapes</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
	<li>1/4 cup minced shallots or onion</li>
	<li>Kosher salt</li>
	<li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
	<li>1 pound dried orecchiette or other medium-sized shaped pasta</li>
	<li>1 1/2 cups fresh ricotta</li>
	<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<div>
<ol>
	<li>Put a large pot of well-salted water on to boil. Set your serving bowls aside to warm up.</li>
	<li>Trim the flower and 1/2" off the other end from each scape. Cut the scapes into 1 1/2" lengths.</li>
	<li>In your largest skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. When the shallots are translucent, add the scapes and saute until mostly tender. This could take 10 minutes or more. If they are really fighting you, add a little water and cover to allow them to steam.</li>
	<li>When the garlic scapes are nearly done, add the pasta to the water and cook according to package directions. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the garlic scapes to a bowl. Add the wine to the saute pan and scrape (deglaze) the bottom of the pan to loosen up any delicious browned bits. Whisk in the remaining 2 tablespoons of the butter, a little bit at a time. Add the garlic scapes back to the pan.</li>
	<li>When the pasta is just short of al dente, reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and drain. Add the pasta to the pan with the garlic scapes and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning; it may need more salt. If the pasta seems a little dry (tight), add a bit of the reserved pasta water until it has a nice, moist shine.</li>
	<li>Divide the pasta among the serving bowls. Top each bowl with several dollops of the ricotta, a few grinds of black pepper, and some of the gremolata. Serve immediately.</li>
