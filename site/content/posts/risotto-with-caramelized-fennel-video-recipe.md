In <a title="Herbivoracious: A Flavor Revolution with 150 Vibrant and Original Vegetarian Recipes" href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">the Herbivoracious cookbook</a>, I've got a recipe for a risotto made with fresh corn and tomato confit (tomatoes that have been slowly roasted in the oven to concentrate their flavor). That recipe is perfect for late summer, but I was taping these videos in the fall, so I made a different version using the beautiful fennel I had available.

More important than the specific ingredients, though, is the method for making risotto. It isn't at all difficult, but there are a few details which are probably easier to understand via video than the written word. Check it out and in no time you'll be making <strong>creamy, tender (but never mushy)</strong> risottos packed with flavor.

You'll see I finished the caramelized fennel risotto with a few drops of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=chefshop%20balsamic&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps">very fine balsamic vinegar from ChefShop</a>. These vinegars are the real deal - <strong>sweet/sour, complex, syrupy from years of aging</strong> in a series of wooden casks in Modena, Italy. As you can see from the link, they are costly, but you dole them out in very small amounts, so a bottle lasts a long time.

If you don't have an aged balsamic, don't try to substitute with a grocery store balsamic vinegar, just omit it. They aren't the same thing at all. I think you should consider investing in the real deal though (and then <strong>don't make salad dressing with it!</strong>)
