The key is to use a polenta that is quick-cooking but not instant. The instant stuff has been parboiled and doesn't taste too great. </p>  <p>My favorite is an organic Argentinian polenta from de la Estancia. It is very finely ground and cooks in just a minute, with a very fresh corn taste. (<a asin="B000HRZX6C" type="amzn">Amazon has a good deal on it</a> but you have to buy 6 packages. You can also find it at Whole Foods.)</p>  <p>You don't absolutely have to have the syrupy aged balsamic vinegar for this dish, but it greatly elevates it. <strong>Don't</strong> substitute the unaged grocery store variety - unless you reduce it with some sugar to make a syrup, but we'll talk about that another time. The <a type="amzn" asin="B0017WSH8M">good stuff is expensive</a>, but even a teaspoon of it is a big treat, so it actually goes a long way. </p>  <p>I guess expensive is relative though. If you want to send me a <a asin="B000LR7VNQ" type="amzn"> two thousand dollar bottle, I'll let you know my shipping address.</a></p>  <p><strong>Polenta With Asparagus And Olives</strong><br /><em>Serves 4<br />Vegetarian and gluten-free; vegan if you omit the cheese</em></p>  <ul><li>2 c. polenta</li>  <li>1 bunch asparagus</li>  <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>  <li>olive oil<br /></li>  <li>1/2 c. good olives, pitted and chopped coarsely</li>  <li>parmigiano reggiano or pecorino romano - 1/2 c. grated, plus more cut with a vegetable peeler for garnish</li>  <li>aged balsamic</li>  <li>salt</li>  <li>pepper</li></ul>  <ol><li>Put 6 c. of water on to boil with 1 t. of salt.

Saute at high heat in olive oil along with the garlic and a couple pinches of salt until tender or to your preferred texture. Add the olives, saute for a minute more, and turn off the heat.</li>  <li>Whisk the polenta into the boiling water and stir continuously until it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in the grated parmesan.</li>  <li>To serve, put 1/4 of the polenta in each of the warmed bowls, top with 1/4 of the asparagus mixture, some thin curls of parmesan, salt and freshly ground pepper. Drizzle on some of the aged balsamic vinegar and serve immediately.</li></ol>
