We were at <a href="http://www.south47farm.com/">South 47 Farm</a> today, took Mini-Me for a hayride and picked amazing cucumbers and blackberries and summer squash, and then went to our neighborhood farmer's market in the afternoon and scored the stunning basil pictured above.&nbsp; If you can see basil that beautiful and not make pesto, you are a stronger person than me. We had it on fresh fettucini also from the market and cubes of the summer squash, and summer is here.</p>
