The Fish Fry opened to a lot of attention in April of &#39;08, garnering notices in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NINY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005NINY">Food &amp; Wine</a> and <span class="removed_link" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N7QH?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005N7QH">Gourmet</span> as well as from our local brigade of reviewers. I&#39;ve been meaning to make it in since then, but with a new baby I couldn&#39;t get there at night. I just recently realized that they&#39;ve been open for a lunch for awhile now, so I got my first taste of the crispy goodness.</p><p>But can a vegetarian even eat a Pike Street Fish Fry? Absolutely. You have three main choices: French fries, green beans, or a mixed fry of assorted vegetables. Each comes with one paper-thin slice of fried lemon, which everyone dotes on, and a choice of sauce. </p><p>I opted for the mixed grill. The vegetables were beautifully battered and fried, with a light and airy shell similar to tempura. The tartar sauce had a good tart edge and pickly crunch. Tasty stuff.</p><p>Now some of you might snub the idea of a fried meal. I grew up in the South, and lived for years in Milwaukee, where a fish fry was mandatory on Friday nights. For me, that meant French fries and coleslaw and I was still happy. I pretty much love anything well fried (fried dark, drained of excess oil, and well salted). So this is no sacrifice to me, though I&#39;ll readily acknowledge it constitutes nothing like a nutritionally balanced lunch! I&#39;m of the school that would rather have a great indulgence occasionally than mediocre ones constantly.</p><p>Pike Street Fish fry is conveniently located outside Neumo&#39;s, so those of you that still have a (night)life can enjoy the deep fried stuff when we all know it tastes best: late and inebriated. There, I said it. </p><p>Don&#39;t let the salvaged Pacific Fish N&#39; Chips sign fool you, that&#39;s the spot.</p><p><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/393953/restaurant/Capitol-Hill/Pike-Street-Fish-Fry-Seattle"><img alt="Pike Street Fish Fry on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/393953/biglink.gif" style="border: medium none ; width: 200px; height: 146px;" /></a></p>
