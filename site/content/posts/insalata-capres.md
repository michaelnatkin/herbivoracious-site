This calls for the finest, ripest heirloom tomatoes you can lay your hands on, sweet &amp; milky fresh mozarella, superb olive oil, flaky sea salt, and fragrant basil. The one in the picture above was made with Purple Cherokees and a handful of mixed heirloom cherry tomatoes.</p>  <p>Besides being incredibly tasty, it goes together in 3 minutes flat. <br />  </p>  <p>So what are you waiting for? </p>  <div class="recipe-card">
