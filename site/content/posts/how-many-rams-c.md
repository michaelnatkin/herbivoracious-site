Sarina brought one home for me from Whole Foods the other day. You can also find them at markets that specialize in Asian produce. I could share with you lots of exciting facts about rambutan but we'll let <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambutan">Wikipedia handle that</a>. Instead I'll just tell you some of the fine things you can do with them once you track them down:</p>  <ol><li>Use as a bottle brush for votive candle holders</li>  <li>Freak your children out by leaving one in their bedsheets</li>  <li>Dangle a string of them festively from above the windshield of your 63 Lincoln with suicide doors</li></ol>  <p>If none of those strikes your fancy, you could just cut one open, remove the seed and eat it. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of fresh lychee, but a little less flowery. Juicy, fleshy and fairly sweet but with a pleasing sour undertone. I think the best way to enjoy them would be to buy a big bunch and sit around with friends peeling and eating them after dinner.<br /><br /><a rel="lightbox" href="/images/2007/11/06/rambutan.jpg"><img width="455" height="302" border="0" src="/images/2007-small/11/06/rambutan.jpg" title="Rambutan" alt="Rambutan" /></a>   <br /></p>
