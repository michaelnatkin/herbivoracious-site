Depending on the cook, in addition to the chiles it is likely to have ginger, cloves, coriander, allspice, and less familiar flavors like long pepper, ajwain, and rue and more. If you don&#39;t have ready access to and Ethiopian grocery, you can <a href="http://www.whats4eats.com/sauces/berbere-recipe" target="_blank">make your own</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QNR2WA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000QNR2WA" rel="_nofollow" target="_blank">buy berbere on Amazon</a>.</p>  <p>I call this recipe &quot;Ethiopian-Style&quot; rather than authentic, because I haven&#39;t seen chard prepared exactly this way. That said, at least to my non-native palate it fit well in a meal with traditional dishes and injera. </p><p>This dish will only take you about 10 minutes of active preparation, and then a little bit of supervision while the greens cook down.</p>  <p>Chard is a great option when you are feeding folks who don&#39;t necessarily love the stronger tasting greens like mustard, collard or kale. But you should feel free to experiment. If you do use chard, don&#39;t event think of throwing out the stems. When cooked through they are succulent and delicious.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
