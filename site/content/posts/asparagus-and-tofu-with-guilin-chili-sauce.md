I most often serve it in a Chinese fermented black bean sauce. The slightly funky saltiness of the preserved beans seems to be a perfect complement to the sweet-bitter crispness of the vegetable. </p><p>I recently picked up my first jar of Guilin Chili Sauce, and as soon as I tasted it, I knew it would also pair well with asparagus. It too contains fermented soybeans, but combined with a very hot, fruity chili pepper. I&#39;m pretty sure this stuff has earned a regular spot in my refrigerator. </p><p>I guess my wife might say that isn&#39;t a very high bar! I&#39;ve got the whole door full of bottles of condiments and sauce components. I can&#39;t tell you how many delicious things I&#39;ve found by going out on a limb to buy sauces at Asian markets without any real idea of what they were beyond that the ingredients were vegetarian. Most of these things are only a few bucks, so there isn&#39;t much risk.</p><p>So reading up on Wikipedia, Guilin is a city in the south of China, and this chili sauce is famous stuff. It is considered one of the city&#39;s three treasures, along with a rice liquor and pickled tofu. Wow, a city famous for three vegetarian specialties! I like it. Anyone from Guilin want to tell us more about it? For example Is the sauce typically prepared at home or bought at a store? </p><p>The brand I found is Lee Kum Kee, which is available at Uwajimaya for those of you in the Seattle area, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CNU5B?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000CNU5B" target="_blank">or you can find it on Amazon</a>. For a rough approximation, you could substitute half regular black-bean paste and half red chili paste (like a sambal oelek or sriracha) and add some garlic and a bit of sugar. </p><div class="recipe-card">
