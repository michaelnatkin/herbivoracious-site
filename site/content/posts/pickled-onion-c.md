recipe:
  name: "Pickled Onions"
  yield: "about 1 cup Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free"
  ingredients:
    - "1 red, white, or sweet onion (yellow is ok but not my favorite)"
    - "rice vinegar (or other mild vinegar) to cover - about 1 c."
    - "1 t. kosher salt"
    - "1/2 t. sugar"
    - "fennel seeds, peppercorns, coriander seeds, chili flakes, citrus zest or whatever you like"
  instructions:
    - "Thinly slice the onion crosswise (making half-rings, not slices). They absorb the flavor better this way."
    - "Put them in a clean tupperware or glass container and cover with vinegar. Actually you don't have to totally cover them because they will wilt enough in the vinegar to be covered the next day."
    - "Add the salt, sugar and spices of your choice. Shake well."
    - "Refrigerate. I don't know officially how long they are safe to keep but I use them for at least a few days."

Pickled onions are one of my favorite condiments. I do this almost automatically if I find myself with half of an onion left on my cutting board from some other dish. It takes all of two minutes and then you have this little jar of tastiness waiting in your fridge for a few days.

What do I do with these allegedly delicious alliums? The possibilities are numerous. They pair well whenever you have something creamy or fatty that wants a vinegary, pungent counterpoint. Almost any sandwich with a cheese component will benefit. Tacos are greatly elevated. You can even toss them with some thinly sliced cucumber or cabbage for a quick salad.

I like to add a little bit of seasoning in with the onions depending on my mood. My most recent batch had a 1/2 t. of <a type="amzn">fennel pollen</a> in it which is amazing.
