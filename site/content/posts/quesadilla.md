<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Crispy Quesadilla with Pecorino and Onion &amp; Garlic Jam</span>

Pretty much everyone loves a quesadilla. Whether you are feeding a 3-year old with mild Monterey jack, or a sophisticated foodie with taleggio and grilled figs, a tortilla and melted cheese is quick to make and irresistible. Let me tell you about a simple trick which will take your quesadillas from tasty but floppy to crispy and delicious.

First a word of warning: this only works with corn tortillas. Flour quesadillas are fine too, but that's a different article. I prefer corn because it adds more flavor and texture.

Anyhow, here is the secret: brush both sides of the quesadilla with a bit of oil before putting them on the pan or griddle on medium-high heat, and then let it cook plenty of time on each side.

I told you it was easy! It doesn't need to be a lot of oil at all, but the difference is amazing. When you cook a quesadilla dry, the shell simply heats up and dries out a bit, which is ok. But when you brush on a bit of oil and let it cook awhile, the tortilla gets crispy / chewy and tastes amazing, like a perfectly fresh tortilla chip.

If you are lucky, a bit of the cheese might run out and brown and stick to the edges like the top of a great mac &amp; cheese and now you've got some serious flavor going.

To get your creative juices flowing, here's a tasty quesadilla I made the other day, filled with green peppercorn pecorino, red onions, and (incredible) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000069KQW?tag=herb-hugo-20">Stonewall Kitchen Roasted Garlic &amp; Onion Savory Jam</a>. I served it with a quick chevre &amp; cilantro sauce and some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a>. You should substitute ingredients wildly and make whatever sounds good to you!

<strong>Crispy Quesadilla with Pecorino and Garlic &amp; Onion Jam</strong>
<em>Makes 1 quesadilla - multiply as needed
Vegetarian &amp; gluten-free; not vegan
Preparation time: under 10 minutes
</em>
<ul>
	<li>2 taco-sized soft corn tortillas</li>
	<li>1/4 cup grated green peppercorn pecorino cheese</li>
	<li>a few thin slices of red onion</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon Stonewall Kitchen garlic &amp; onion jam (see link above)</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil (anything that can handle heat, like canola)</li>
	<li>pinch of kosher or sea salt</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons goat cheese (aka chevre; my favorite is Laura Chenel)</li>
	<li>small handful cilantro leaves, chopped fine - reserve a couple for garnish</li>
	<li>smoked paprika (see link above)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Heat a cast-iron skillet, flat griddle, or other frying pan over medium heat.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle the cheese on one tortilla and top it with the onion.</li>
	<li>Spread the jam on the other tortilla and cover the first one.</li>
	<li>Brush one side with the oil and put that side down in the skillet, then brush the other side with oil.</li>
	<li>Cook for several minutes on each side, until it is developing beautiful crispy brown spots. The one in the picture above could actually have gone a few more minutes.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, beat the goat cheese with a bit of water until smooth like thick yogurt. Bruise the minced cilantro with your fingertips to release the flavor and stir it in to the goat cheese with a bit of salt to taste.</li>
	<li>When the quesadilla is done on both side, remove it to a cutting board and carefully cut it into quarters with decisive presses of a sharp knive. Place on plate, sprinkle with a bit of salt, dust the plate with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a>, add a dollop of the goat cheese sauce and munch intently.</li>
</ol>
