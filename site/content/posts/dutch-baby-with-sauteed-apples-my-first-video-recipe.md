This worked out kind of cool - today's post <strong>happens to be my 500th on Herbivoracious</strong>, dating back to July of 2007, my first post since leaving my day job, and it is my very first video recipe. For the extended e-book version of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558327452/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=vegfoodie-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1558327452">my cookbook</a>, Harvard Common Press asked me to make a series of videos. I was thrilled, and stipulated that I only wanted to do it if we could have high quality videos, professionally shot and edited. I wasn't interested in making a bunch of shaky iPhone vids!

Harvard Common was, of course, on board with doing a topnotch job, and I was lucky enough to convince the inestimable Tim Mar of <a href="http://chefshop.com/" target="_blank">ChefShop.com</a> to shoot and edit them. Before starting one of my favorite specialty food stores, Tim was a world class videographer and continues to do some video side projects. Tim had always been kind to me when I'd visit the store, even when I was <strong>utterly wet behind the ears</strong> as a blogger, so I knew he's be great to work with.

The videos were shot over the course of several days in Tim's beautiful kitchen (I wish it were mine!) on his Nikon D3. I should have taken pictures of the lighting setups; he's got the ability to make a rainy winter day in Seattle look like a <strong>warm, glowing fall afternoon</strong>. The best part was that we got to hang out and talk (and eat) while we shot, so I learned a ton about all the incredible ingredients that he and his wife and business partner Eliza source for ChefShop. Tim knows all of the farmers and producers personally, so each product comes with a fascinating backstory.

I'm going to be able to share some of the videos here with you on the blog, starting with this Dutch baby, which is one of my all time favorite things to serve for brunch. If you enjoy the video, please share it with your friends! And if the video desperately makes you want a VitaMix, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LQETHI/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">you can jump right over to Amazon and get it</a>. You'll never regret it, that thing kicks butt.
