It hits all those sweet, tangy and fresh notes that wake up your palate at the beginning of a meal, or refresh it after a bite of spicy curry. My wife and I have been known to narrow down our selection of Vietnamese restaurants purely based on the quality of their mango salad, and to use the leftover dressing to flavor our <a href="/2009/10/vietnamese-vermicelli-bun-with-ginger-grapefruit-sauce-recipe/" target="_blank" title="bun (Vietnamese rice noodle bowl)">bun</a> when the house sauce isn&#39;t vegetarian.</p>  <p>This salad works best with slightly underripe mangos. You want them to be firm, but not rock hard. The easiest way to cut them is with a mandoline, and it makes for neater presentation. You can do it with a knife too, it just takes a little more time. </p>  <p>I&#39;ve experimented with different ways to make the dressing without fish sauce. Often a little soy sauce works as an umami-rich substitute, but in this case I like a bit of Chinese sesame oil instead. Not traditional but I think it works very well. I like the dressing to be rather sweet. You should adjust it to balance the particular mangos you are working with.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
