This recipe is a nice way to turn them into a delicious side dish with minimal effort. It mostly handles its own business in the oven, so you can focus on the rest of dinner.</p> <p>We normally think of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GUU6DX2?tag=herb-hugo-20">dried mint</a> only for making mint tea, but in Persian cuisine it is frequently used in savory foods, where it adds a pleasing hint of bitterness and only a hint of actual mintiness. Don&#39;t think of it as a replacement for fresh mint, think of it as a completely different product.</p> <p>This dish goes great with <a href="/2011/06/chickpea-and-potato-stew-with-baharat-recipe.html" target="_blank">Chickpea and Potato Stew</a>&#0160;and <a href="/2010/05/persian-crispy-rice-recipe/" target="_blank">Persian rice pilaf</a> (chelo with tahdig), or this <a href="/2008/04/recipe-syrian-y/" target="_blank">Syrian red lentil soup</a>.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
