I learned about them from Diana Kennedy&#39;s magnificient <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0609602470?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">My Mexico</a> and thought that I could replace the pork filling with yams, increase the portion, and make an unusual and delicious vegetarian entree. </p>  <p>The cakes came out great; they fry up with a crispy exterior and somewhat creamy inside. If you have had an Indian dosa, which is made from a lentil batter, the crust is kind of like that. Both of my kids loved them too, which was a nice bonus. The older one now calls them &quot;yummy cakes&quot; and is lobbying for a repeat performance.</p>  <p>I served the bocoles with this refreshing <a href="/2009/11/jicama-orange-and-radish-salad-recipe/" target="_blank">jicama, radish and orange salad</a>, and a spoonful of homemade pipian, a type of mole made with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TVJ9GSD?tag=herb-hugo-20">pumpkin seeds (pepitas)</a>.</p>  <p>Fresh masa is a delight to work with, much nicer than dough made from dry masa harina. Your best bet for finding it is to locate a place that makes fresh corn tortillas (a <em>tortilleria</em>). That should be easy in parts of the country that have large Mexican populations. In Seattle I&#39;ve had luck at La Bendicion on Beacon Hill, if I ask a day in advance, or I hear you can get it at the The Mexican Grocery in Pike Place. If you don&#39;t have fresh masa, just buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZQMR7L2?tag=herb-hugo-20">masa harina</a> flour and mix it according to the package directions for tortillas.</p>  <p>I also bought pre-made Ducal-brand refried black beans. If you don&#39;t have that, simply fry some onion and garlic with canned black beans and then thoroughly puree them with enough liquid to make a smooth paste.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
<p><strong>Bocoles (Masa and Black Bean Cakes) with Spicy Yams</strong><br /><em>Serves 6 as an entree or 12 as an appetizer<br />Vegetarian, vegan if you omit the crema, and gluten-free</em></p>  <p><em>For the yam filling:</em></p>  <ul> <li>2 tablespoons oil</li> <li>1 white onion, diced</li> <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li> <li>2 medium yams, peeled and finely diced (see below)</li> <li>2 or more jalapeno peppers, minced</li> <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li> <li>salt</li> </ul> <p><em>For the bocoles:</em></p>  <ul> <li>2 pounds (about 4 cups) masa or prepared masa harina, no wetter than necessary</li> <li>2 cups refried black beans (Ducal brand is good or make your own)</li> <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li> <li>salt</li> <li>oil for pan frying</li> </ul> <p><em>For serving:</em></p>  <ul> <li>shredded romaine lettuce hearts</li> <li>crema or sour cream</li> <li>salsa or jicama salad</li> <li>optional: mole or pipian sauce</li> </ul> <ol> <li>The easiest way to cut the yams is to make strips using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YDO2LG?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">mandoline</a> and then use a knife to cut the strips into very small cubes. Heat the oil in a large skillet over a medium flame. Saute the onion and garlic for 1 minute. Add the yams, jalapeno and cumin and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until the yams are fully tender. Taste and adjust seasoning - they will likely need more salt. Feel free to make the filling spicier if that suits you.</li> <li>Thoroughly mix the masa, refried beans, baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Taste and add more salt if needed. Heat 1/8&quot; of oil in a large skillet over a medium flame. Make golf-ball sized balls of the dough and pat them between your hands into a pancake about 1/4&quot; thick or so. Fry for about 3 or 4 minutes until brown on the outside and cooked but still soft on the inside. Diana Kennedy says 7 minutes per side but I found it didn&#39;t it take that long; try a tester and see what you like best.</li> <li>Serve as soon as possible, on a bed of shredded lettuce, topped with a generous amount of the yam filling, and garnished with crema. Pass the salad or salsa and optional mole on the side.</li> </ol>
