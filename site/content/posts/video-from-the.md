<p>Just a quick note - Keren over at <a href="http://savvysavorer.blogspot.com">Savvy Savorer</a> put up <a href="http://savvysavorer.blogspot.com/2008/01/food-tv-for-seattle-bloggers.html">videos</a> of everyone at the last Seattle blogger brunch talking about their dishes. Thanks Keren! While I'm babbling about white beans (did I really say something about Moorish influence?) you can hear my daughter repeatedly asking for water. Bad daddy.</p>
