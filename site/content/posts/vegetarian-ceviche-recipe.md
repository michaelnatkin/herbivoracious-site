Variations of it are served throughout Latin America. Each country has its own <strong>special twists</strong> on the ingredients, sauce, or crispy accompaniments. </p>  <p>Obviously it isn&#39;t the same thing, but you can absolutely make a vegetarian dish that capitalizes on some of those <strong>pleasures</strong>. If you think in terms of a composed salad, include some tropical and spicy elements, and use a dressing of citrus with no oil, there is lots of room to play. I included oyster mushrooms and (sustainably harvested) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074H5M1BL?tag=herb-hugo-20">hearts of palm</a> as somewhat <strong>humorous references</strong> to seafood - the oyster mushrooms by name and the palm by shape.</p>  <p>Ceviche usually includes something salty and crispy for contrast. Roasted corn kernels (something like <strong>Corn Nuts</strong>), popcorn, fried plantains are popular choices. I was short on time for today&#39;s dish so I simply used tortilla chips, but if I would have preferred a spiced up popcorn.</p>  <p>This would be fun to serve with cocktails, or as the first course of a dinner party.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
