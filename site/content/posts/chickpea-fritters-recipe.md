  name: "Chickpea Fritters"
  ingredients:
    - "3 cups cooked chickpeas (or two 15 oz. cans, drained and rinsed)"
    - "1/2 cup green onions (white and light green parts only), very thinly sliced"
    - "5 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "1/4 teaspoon minced rosemary leaves"
    - "3/4 teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "zest of 1 lemon"
    - "juice of 1/2 lemon"
    - "1 egg, lightly beaten"
    - "1/2 cup all-purpose flour"
    - "1/4 cup homemade breadcrumbs"
    - "1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds"
    - "oil for shallow frying"
    - "flaky sea salt"
  instructions:
    - "Combine all ingredients except the oil and flaky sea salt in a food processor and buzz until you have a fairly uniform mixture, but stop before it is completely pureed. We want some texture left. You should be able to form it into a ball that holds its shape. It should be neither crumbly nor a batter. Add liquid or breadcrumbs as necessary to find the right moisture level."
    - "Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over a medium-high flame. Take a golf-ball sized piece of dough, press it in your hands into a flattened 3-inch patty and place in the skillet. Repeat with as many as will fit comfortably. Fry on one side until golden brown, about 3 minutes, then flip and brown the other side. Remove to paper towels and finish with a little bit of sea salt."
