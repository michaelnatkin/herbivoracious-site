</a><em>Austin-Style Breakfast Tacos</em>

I've had the good fortune to travel to Austin a couple of times in the last year or so, and it is always good fun. Like Portland, Milwaukee, or Brooklyn, it is a place where people understand that work is important, but having a beer and a bite with friends, listening to music, or just kicking back on the front porch is just as important.

Austin might be most famous for barbeque, but breakfast tacos seem to be a close second. Ask five Austinites where to get the best breakfast tacos and you'll get six opinions. One time I had a flight out to catch at 6 AM, and several friends got into a 15 minute discussion of where I could ask the cab driver to stop at 4:30. (I wasn't quite that committed, but I probably should have been - the options at the airport were dismal indeed.)

Like all tacos, the ingredient choices can be flexible. There are just two key principles: use good, soft, warm corn tortillas, and don't overfill them. A taco should be just about three bites of food, and if you are hungry, well you just need more tacos.

The version below uses refried beans, potatoes, scrambled eggs, salsa, and minced cilantro &amp; onion. If you want to make a vegan version, try <a href="/2008/09/achiote-rubbed/" target="_blank">butternut squash</a> or <a href="/2010/05/grilled-tofu-and-pepper-vegetarian-tacos-recipe/" target="_blank">tofu</a>.
