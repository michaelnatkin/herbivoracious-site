<em>Wacky Chana Chaat - Spicy Chickpea Snack</em>

Chaat is a whole family of amazing snack foods from India that are served by street vendors and informal restaurants. Chaat can be anything from aloo tiki (potato fritters - there's a recipe in <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">my book</a>) to pani puri (little crispy hollow crackers that you poke a hole in, fill with a potato and chickpea mixture, then dunk in a spicy cold broth) to dahi vada (fried lentil dumplings drowned in sweet yogurt). It is almost hard to say what the defining characteristic of  a chaat is, but after awhile you know one when you see one, and you'll probably want to <strong>get on the outside of it</strong> as quickly as possible.

Today's recipe is a variation of a traditional chana (chickpea) chaat. I'm <strong>calling it "wacky"</strong> because I used Trader Joe's thin-mini rice crackers to add a crunchy component. Most chaats have a crunch factor, from crispy noodles (sev) to puffed rice (bhel). I chose the rice crackers just because I had them lying around and  they have a nice neutral, salty crunch that I thought would work perfectly. If you use a different kind of rice cracker, just be sure it is a plain one, <strong>not glazed with  teriyaki or wrapped with nori</strong> - that wouldn't go well. You can do everything else ahead, but don't mix the chaat until the last minute, because you don't want the crackers to lose their snap.

Chaat masala is a spice mix that is used in many different chaats; you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JSM27M?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">buy it</a> or I show you how to make a <strong>simplified version</strong> of it below. You also might like to add a tamarind chutney for another layer of flavor. The general aesthetic of chaat is a real riot of flavors and textures.

Oh, and in other news, after much "fun" getting the colors right, I finally have my Zazzle store open, so pop on over if you have just been hankering to get an <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/herbivoracious/gifts" target="_blank">Herbivoracious t-shirt, apron or trucker hat</a>.
