But if you haven&#39;t had them, you have been missing out on one of the all time delicious and cheap eats. My wife and I have been known to roll out of bed in the morning and say &quot;Vietnamese sandwiches for lunch? Yep!&quot;. </p>  <p>A typical sandwich is on an 8 inch crusty French roll (an imperial legacy). It contains julienned cucumber, carrot and pickled daikon, cilantro, optionally slices of jalapeno, a little light mayonnaise-based dressing, lots of black pepper, and the filling of your choice. For meat eaters there is a wide variety of choices, but there is always a tofu option, Banh Mi Chay. And the best part is that this treat usually costs about $1.50, rarely more than $2.00. One sandwich is pretty filling, but at that price if you are hungry you might want to split three among two people. You generally order at a counter and wait a few minutes while they are made, which gives you time to check out the other prepared foods and grocery items to tempt you. Always on offer is fresh-made Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk.</p>  <p>So where do you find Vietnamese sandwiches? If you happen to be in the Seattle area I&#39;ve listed a few places below. If not, look for a Vietnamese deli or grocery, they will either have them or know where you can get them. Most Vietnamese restaurants *don&#39;t* sell them, because they are take-out food, not a sit-down meal. </p>  <p>Favorite Seattle options:</p>    <p>Saigon Deli (picture above is from there, my favorite)<br />Seattle Deli</p>  <p>There are tons of other small shops along Jackson that also offer Banh Mi. If you have a different favorite, please add a comment! Also <a href="http://www.baguettebox.com">Baguette Box</a> offers a slightly non-traditional but delicious version at the wildly overinflated price of $4.25 :). The nice thing is that it gives you options outside of the international district and a hip vibe. </p><p><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/896/Seattle/Central-District/Saigon-Deli.html"><img alt="Saigon Deli in Seattle" height="146" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/896/biglink.gif" width="200" /></a> <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/1291/Seattle/Central-District/Seattle-Deli.html"><img alt="Seattle Deli in Seattle" height="146" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1291/biglink.gif" width="200" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/1468/Seattle/Capitol-Hill/Baguette-Box.html"><img alt="Baguette Box in Seattle" height="146" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/1468/biglink.gif" width="200" /></a><a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/55069/restaurant/Fremont/Baguette-Box-Seattle"><img alt="Baguette Box on Urbanspoon" height="146" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/55069/biglink.gif" width="200" /></a></p>
