<p>Rice and Peas is a classic Jamaican dish, traditionally served on Sundays. Peas in this case actually refer to kidney beans, pigeon peas or cowpeas. The rice is richly flavored with coconut milk, garlic, crushed green onions, thyme, and, if you dare, a Scotch Bonnet or habanero pepper.</p>
<p>Even though the pepper is left whole, it will still infuse the dish with a subtle bit of heat if you choose to use it. For a bit more spice, cut a slit in the pepper, and if you are really crazy you can cut it up – wearing rubber gloves!</p>
<p>I prefer to make Rice and Peas in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007WQ9YNO?tag=herb-hugo-20">rice cooker</a>, but if you want to do it on the stovetop, the recipe below offers both options.</p>
<p>If you make the beans from scratch, you can substitute 1 cup of the bean liquid for part of the water in the recipe for a “dirty rice” look with a slightly earthier flavor.</p>

<p><strong>Jamaican Rice and Peas</strong>
<br /><em>Vegan & Gluten-free / Serves 4  / 10 minutes active (40 minutes total)</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I330QEQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">basmati rice</a> (or 3 measures with the cup that comes with most rice makers)</li>
<li>1 14 oz. can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SRKCGM?tag=herb-hugo-20">coconut milk</a></li>
<li>4 green onions cooked with the rice + 1 for garnish</li>
<li>1 ½ cups cooked kidney (or other beans, see above), drained</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
<li>3 big sprigs fresh thyme</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>several grinds of black pepper</li>
<li>1 Scotch Bonnet or habanero pepper (optional)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>If using a rice cooker, put the 3 measures of rice in the pot, add the coconut milk, and top up with enough water to reach the 3 cup line, plus ¼ cup more water. If using the stove, choose a pot with a tight fitting lid, and combine 2 cups of rice, the can of coconut milk, and 2 3/4 cups of water.</li>
<li>Leave 4 of the green onions whole, but crush them with a rolling pin or the back of your knife. Add them to the pot, along with the beans, garlic, thyme, salt, black pepper, and the optional whole chile pepper. Stir everything together.</li>
<li>If using the rice cooker, turn on and run a normal cycle. If using the stove, bring to a boil, cover, and reduce to a bare simmer, then cook until all of the water is absorbed.</li>
<li>To serve, remove the whole green onions, thyme sprigs, and chile if using. Fluff the rice and turn out into a bowl. Garnish with the remaining green onion, finely sliced, and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
