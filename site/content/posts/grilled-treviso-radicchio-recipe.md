<p>Treviso is a type of radicchio that is hugely popular in Italy, and is becoming easier to find at farmer’s markets in America.  Treviso, like all radicchio, is quite bitter. I find a few bites of it invigorating but it might be too much for some folks. A milder alternative is to use a small head of Romaine lettuce for this dish, removing the coarse outer leaves first.</p>
<p>Grilled treviso a great first course when you already have a grill fired up for your entrees. You can serve it as is, or with grilled bread for an unusual bruschetta. A few toasted walnuts make a spectacular addition.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a grill going, a grill pan on the stovetop can work as well.</p>

<p><strong>Grilled Treviso Radicchio</strong>
<br /><em>Gluten-free / Serves 4 / 5 minutes if you have a hot grill</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 head Treviso radicchio, regular radicchio, or romaine lettuce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004UB692I?tag=herb-hugo-20">aged balsamic vinegar</a></li>
<li>about 12 thin slices of Parmesan cheese, cut with a vegetable peeler</li>
<li>handful of toasted walnuts</li>
<li>flaky sea salt</li>
<li>fresh ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Preheat a grill or a cast-iron grill pan on your stovetop to a moderate temperature.</li>
<li>Cut the head of radicchio in half, lengthwise and straight through the stem. Do not cut off the stem, you need it to hold the head together.</li>
<li>Brush the cut sides of the radicchio with olive oil. Place on the grill, cut side down and press down firmly to maximize contact area. Cook for about 2-3 minutes, until nicely seared and starting to wilt.</li>
<li>Remove from the grill and place on serving platter. Garnish with a generous drizzle of the aged balsamic, the cheese, walnuts, a sprinkle of sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Cut into bite sized pieces and serve immediately.</li>
</ol>
