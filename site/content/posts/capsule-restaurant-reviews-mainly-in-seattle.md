<p>For those of you in the Seattle area (or visitors to our fair city), I&#39;ve started a page of <a href="/capsule-restaurant-reviews/">capsule restaurant reviews</a>. There is always a link over in the Categories side of the lefthand sidebar. I&#39;ll still put <a href="/restaurants/">full reviews with photos</a> in the main section of the blog, but if I just dash off a few paragraphs on a restaurant, I&#39;ll put it in the capsule section, since they are probably not of much interest to readers around the rest of the globe. Comments welcome as always! </p>
