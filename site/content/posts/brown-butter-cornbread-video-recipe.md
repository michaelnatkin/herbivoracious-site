The brown butter cornbread recipe <a title="Herbivoracious: A Flavor Revolution with 150 Vibrant and Original Vegetarian Recipes" href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">in my book</a> is one I come back to over and over again, whenever a bowl of vegetarian chili or black bean soup is on the menu. The brown butter flavor somehow amplifies the taste of the corn. I use an easy trick that is popular in modernist kitchens for <strong>improving the flavor of brown butter</strong>, by adding more non-fat milk solids. Watch the video for the technique and an explanation of why it works.

Oh, and by the way, a double batch of this recipe cooks up great in a 12" cast iron skillet, and I can pretty much guarantee you that it is impossible to make too much cornbread.
