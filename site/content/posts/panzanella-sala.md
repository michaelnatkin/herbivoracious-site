I didn't know whether to fully believe this or not given how great the farmer's market produce we get in Seattle is. Now I know what they were talking about. The average produce is really much better, maybe a shade shy of the best farmer's market for basic vegetables but way, way above typical American grocery store fare. Also, the standard for preparation of salads is so much higher. You never see just some sad lettuce and vegetables washed three days ago, thrown in a bowl, awash in dressing. Probably because of the hot climate and the good produce, and the seriousness which people in this part of the world apply to their dining, the salads are often superb even at pretty run-of-the-mill places. The picture above is of a so-called Panzanella at Spaghettim, which is&nbsp; a small chain of Italian restaurants. It really only had a few pieces of bread, so it ate more like a good Greek Village salad. But it was incredibly refreshing and tasty, with lots of mint, and a bargain for around $10.</p>  <p><strong>Details</strong><br />35 Hillel St.<br />Jerusalem, Israel<br />02/623-5547</p>
