<em>Green Apple Kimchi, shown here with Tofu Lettuce Wrap and Hatcho Miso Sauce</em>

As I mentioned in the <a href="/2012/08/tomato-and-nectarine-salad-with-a-korean-dressing-recipe/" target="_blank">Tomato and Nectarine Salad</a>, I've fallen in love with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004W71CJU/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gochugaru (Korean chili powder</a>). It is spicy, but not so spicy that you can't use enough of it to also appreciate its fruity, tart notes. I like using it to make quick "kimchi". I'm putting the "kimchi" in quotes because there is no fermentation at all. I'm <strong>not</strong> putting it in quotes because this is apple, not cabbage - Koreans make kimchi from all sorts of things besides those familiar leaves.

You can take this same blueprint and make a quick, spicy pickle out of just about anything - cucumbers, peaches, daikon. Use your imagination! You can even add a little bit of juice from fermented kimchi to get some of that lactic acid punch in there. Otherwise, I include a bit of rice vinegar.  These kinds of pickles make a great <a href="/2011/06/three-easy-banchan-korean-side-dishes-recipes/" target="_blank">banchan</a> for any Korean meal, or just eat it on rice (maybe with a fried egg), or on a sandwich, or ... the possibilities are endless, because almost any dish is better with a bit of heat, fresh crunch, acid and salt.

In the photo, I've used the green apple kimchi on a lettuce wrap with <a href="/2012/05/how-to-make-tofu-really-freaking-delicious-tofu-101/" target="_blank">pan-fried tofu</a> and a sauce made from hatcho miso, soy sauce, rice vinegar, mirin, kochujang, sesame oil and ginger. Sorry, I didn't write down any proportions for that - it was a quick improvisation because when I went to grab my ssamjang out of the refrigerator it was way past expiration date.
