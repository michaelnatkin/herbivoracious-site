If so, I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t spend a lot of time on them for your average homecooked meal. The purpose this type of garnish serves is purely visual, and the aesthetics are dubious at best.&#0160;</p> <p><strong>There is a much better way!</strong></p> <p>Well chosen garnishes can completely transform your food with minimal effort. They add color, yes, but also <strong>complementary tastes</strong>, <strong>aromas</strong> and <strong>textures</strong>.</p> <p>Have you heard of the concept of <strong>sensory specific satiety</strong>? Psychologists have studied this phenomenon in great detail. Basically it means that your palate quickly tires of a single taste, but will revive quickly when offered something different.&#0160;</p> <p>In many food cultures, individual dishes aren&#39;t often garnished, but a whole meal consists of many small plates. Some of these will be freshly made, while others will be from the pantry or refrigerator, so it isn&#39;t a huge burden on the cook. Korean meals come with a wide variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banchan" target="_self">banchan</a>.&#0160;Indian thalis typically have a selection of chutneys, pickles, pappadam, breads, raitas and so forth to complement the main dishes.</p> <p>This approach isn&#39;t so common in Western cuisines. Even if we have more than one dish, they are often served in courses. This makes garnish even more important, lest satiety kick in and the dish grow tiresome.&#0160;</p> <p>Many times you can garnish with an herb whose flavor is already cooked in, to reinforce the effect. For example, celery leaves on a celery soup or cilantro leaf on a curry with coriander seeds. Because these garnishes are fresh, they still have the <strong>aromatic high notes</strong> that cooked food loses. Applied at the last moment, the warmth of the dish will send those aromas into the air, whetting everyone&#39;s appetite.</p> <p>Here are some ideas for simple garnishes that actually elevate a dish, not just decorate it.</p> <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 20px;"><a href="/2009/09/french-lentil-salad-recipe/" style="float: left;"><img alt="" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340148c8573ec9970c" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb883401538e2ae70e970b-500wi.webp" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" /></a>Fresh herbs: I know I made fun of parsley sprigs, but parsley and other fresh herbs can be fantastic. They should go on the food, not next to it, and the flavor should make sense in the context of the dish, like the mint and parsley on this <a href="/2009/09/french-lentil-salad-recipe/" target="_blank">Latin-American French Lentil Salad</a>.</p> <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 20px;"><a href="/2010/06/tofu-and-kimchi-dinner-for-one-recipe/" style="float: left;"><img alt="" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340148c8573ec9970c" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834015431fe3d65970c-500wi.webp" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" /></a>Vegetables: finely diced cucumbers, thinly sliced jalapeno, cherry tomato halves, and quick fresh salsas add crunch and refreshment. I especially love green onions, like on this <a href="/2010/06/tofu-and-kimchi-dinner-for-one-recipe/" target="_blank">Tofu and Kimchi Dinner for One</a>.</p> <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 20px;"><a href="/2009/04/fava-beans-potatoes-saffron-rice/" style="float: left;"><img alt="" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340148c8573ec9970c" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834015431fe4197970c-500wi.webp" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" /></a>Cheese: Parmigiano reggiano, pecorino romano and grated cheddar are all obvious choices, but don&#39;t forget <a href="/2009/04/fava-beans-potatoes-saffron-rice/" target="_blank">crumbled feta</a> or <a href="/2011/04/warm-grapes-toasted-pita-bread-and-ricotta-salata-recipe/" target="_blank">ricotta salata</a>.</p> <p style="clear: both; padding-top: 20px;"><a href="/2010/01/brussels-sprout-gratin-with-heretical-technique-recipe/" style="float: left;"><img alt="" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340148c8573ec9970c" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834015431fe470e970c-250wi.webp" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;" /></a>Homemade breadcrumbs add great crunch; they can be plain or flavored with garlic or herbs.
