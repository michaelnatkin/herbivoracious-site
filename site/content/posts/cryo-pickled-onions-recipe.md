<p>Aki Kamozawa & H. Alexander Talbot, in their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307717402?tag=herb-hugo-20">Ideas In Food cookbook</a>, have terrific chapters on pickling, and on freezing food to intentionally modify texture. I like to combine these two methods into something I call “cryo-pickling”.</p>
<p>When you freeze a vegetable, ice crystals puncture the cell walls. A slow thaw allows water to drain out, resulting in a denser product with more concentrated flavors. If you do this same process in the presence of a pickling liquid, as the water goes out, the pickling flavors have the opportunity to migrate in.</p>
<p>In the example below, we are pickling onions with mild Asian spices. You can serve this with the Pear and Gouda Salad on , and use the pickling liquid as part of the dressing.</p>
<p>Feel free to change either the vegetable or the marinade; this method is very flexible. How about cantaloupe with Sichuan peppercorns? Experiment and have fun!</p>
