This is one of my favorite kitchen creativity games. Take a single ingredient, and cut it as many ways as you can think of, then observe the way the cuts and textures change your perception. Then take it a step further and let those new perceptions suggest simple flavor pairings.</p>  <p>These enormous, nearly black seedless grapes gave me all sorts of ideas.&nbsp;</p>  <ul> <li>Peeled and rolled in crispy crumbled rice crackers, Hawaiian black salt</li> <li>Sliced so thin they are transparent, with fennel pollen and lemon zest</li> <li>Peeled and cut into irregular "icebergs" with cilantro/pepita pesto</li> <li>Fileted with sunflower butter</li> <li>(below) Tops and bottoms removed, thinly sliced vertically, again with the cilantro/pepita pesto</li> </ul> <p>Serve chilled.</p> <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a77bdf21970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img  alt="Grape_Fun2" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a77bdf21970b " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a77bdf21970b-500wi.jpg" /></a><br><em>Grapes with cilantro/pepita pesto</em></p>
