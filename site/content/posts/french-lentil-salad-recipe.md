There was always the shadow of a good, simple, rustic dish there. </p>  <p>I like to make it with French lentils, otherwise known as green lentils. The best ones are from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3XFW1C?tag=herb-hugo-20">from the area of Puy</a>. They are a little smaller and rounder than the normal brown lentil, and they hold their shape even when tender, instead of voluntarily pureeing themselves into lentil soup. Another option are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNPW71P?tag=herb-hugo-20">black &quot;beluga&quot; lentils</a>.</p>  <p>Once you have cooked lentils in hand, a salad is a simple thing. You can pick any combination of cooked and raw vegetables that go well together, fresh herbs, and a straightforward dressing of citrus juice and olive oil. </p>  <p>I opted for Latin American flavors this time. with tiny roasted potatoes, cucumber, red onion, avocado, radish, lime juice, and a gilding of ranchero cheese. You could just as easily use lemon instead of lime, feta instead of ranchero, add thyme and oregano and call it Greek. </p>  <p><strong>Latin-American French Lentil Salad<br /></strong><em>Serves 4 as a main, 8 as a side dish<br />Vegetarian and gluten-free; vegan if you omit the cheese</em><div class="recipe-card">
<strong><br /></strong></p>  <ul> <li>1 1/2 cups French green lentils (lentils de Puy AOC are the best)</li> <li>1 cup tiny potatoes or cubed larger potatoes</li> <li>1/2 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded and diced</li> <li>6 radishes, thinly sliced</li> <li>1/2 small red onion, small dice</li> <li>big handful mint leaves (chopped if large, reserve a few for garnish)</li> <li>big handful parsley leaves (reserve a few for garnish)</li> <li>lime juice </li> <li>extra virgin olive oil</li> <li>salt</li> <li>1/2 cup crumbled queso fresco</li> <li>fresh ground black pepper</li> <li>1 avocado, sliced<br /> </li> </ul> <ol> <li>Rinse the lentils and pick them over for stones and debris. In a saucepan, cover them with plenty of water and boil for about 25 minutes until tender but not falling apart. Add more water if needed. Drain and allow to cool.</li> <li>Meanwhile, toss the potatoes with olive oil and salt and roast at 400 F. until tender and browned. You can also do this in a skillet.</li> <li>Combine the drained lentils, the potatoes, cucumber, radishes, onion, mint and parsley, and 2 teaspoons of salt and toss well. </li> <li>I dress this salad by eye and taste. Start with the juice of 1 lime and a good glug of olive oil and then toss. You&#39;ve got it right when there is a slight gloss of dressing but it isn&#39;t swimming. Taste and adjust the balance of acidity and salt as needed.</li> <li>You can refrigerate at this point for a day or two, no problem. Just bring back to room temperature or slightly warmer before serving.</li> <li>To serve, garnish with the queso fresco, mint and parsley, a nice grind of black pepper, and the avocado. </li> </ol> <ul> </ul>
