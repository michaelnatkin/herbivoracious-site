Eat this before an episode of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001FB4W0W?tag=herb-hugo-20">True Blood</a>  and you'll sleep better. But maybe don't serve it on a first date.</p><p><em>Alioli</em> is a close Spanish cousin to the French <em>aioli</em>. It is a simple home-made mayonnaise which comes together in just a few minutes. You can serve it with any sort of vegetable, raw or cooked. It is also delicious with a slab of cold tortilla (Spanish frittata) on crusty bread.&nbsp;</p><p>Alioli goes famously with potatoes, whether roasted, pan-fried, or simply boiled in their jackets as I did. Your guests can simply smash a potato lightly on their plate and drizzle on a bit of the sauce. You can make it at the last minute, or up to a day in advance (refrigerating of course). The garlic flavor becomes even more intense but rounded overnight.</p><p>Like any homemade mayonnaise, it is made with raw eggs. Use your own judgement whether it is safe to eat. You may be able to find pasteurized whole eggs at some stores, which would make them safer. I personally wouldn't serve it to the very young or old, or anyone with a compromised immune system, but I happily eat it myself. I eat cookie dough too. I guess I just live on the edge like that.</p><p>Did I mention this is really garlicky and delicious?</p><div class="recipe-card">
