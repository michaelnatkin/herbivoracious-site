This one has straight ahead Spanish flavors with the green olives, orange zest, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO5CRY?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked paprika</a>. It goes together in just a minute in a food processor. This tapenade is on the thicker side and works better as a crostini or bruschetta topping than as a dip.</p>  <p>One small trick here is to soak the olives in hot water for a few minutes to remove some of the saltiness. You can do the same with black olives or capers in similar recipes.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
