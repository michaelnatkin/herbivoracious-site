It is a riff on a popular dish from Seattle&#39;s Osteria La Spiga, where they do it with Toma cheese wrapped in grape leaves. </p><p>This version is even simpler. You should feel free to try it with other cheeses and other herbs. Mint or basil would be delicious. How about grilled Halloumi cheese instead of the chevre?</p><p>I recently received a sample of an organic extra-virgin olive oil from <a href="http://www.gaea.gr/">Gaea</a>. I used it for this dish and it added a very clean, clear, fruity and pepper note that I was happy with. I&#39;m also impressed that their oils are certified carbon-neutral.</p><p>The finished dish can be plated family style like you see above, or in individual portions. Serve it with a crusty baguette or a grilled flatbread.</p><div class="recipe-card">
