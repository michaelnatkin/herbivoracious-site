<p>Bocoloes are little pan-fried cake of masa and mashed black beans, typically served as anantojito (appetizer). I learned about them from Diana Kennedy's magnificient opus, My Mexico. For my version, I’ve replaced the pork filling with spiced up pan-fried sweet potatoes, and increase the portion to make them into a satisfying vegetarian entrée.</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion about sweet potatoes and yams, which aren’t even related. The sweet potatoes I want you to use for this have a dark orange-brown skin and orange flesh. You may well find them labeled yams in your grocery!</p>
<p>The cakes fry up with a crispy exterior and somewhat creamy inside. If you have had an Indian dosa, which is made from a lentil batter, the crust is kind of like that. My kids love them too; the older one now calls them "yummy cakes".</p>
<p>Serve the bocoles with Jicama, Orange and Radish Salad, guacamole, or the salsa of your choice.</p>
<p>If you don’t have refried black beans, just cook ½ an onion and 2 cloves of garlic in a couple tablespoons of oil, add cooked black beans and a little oil and mash them to a smooth puree, adding water as needed. Season to taste.</p>

<p><strong>Bocoles with Spicy Sweet Potatoes</strong>
<br /><em>Gluten-free, vegan optional / Serves 6 / 40 minutes</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>For the sweet potato filling:</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
<li>1 white onion, diced</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and finely diced</li>
<li>2 or more jalapeno peppers, minced</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoons powdered chile New Mexico</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
<li>juice of 1 lime</li>
<li>For the bocoles:</li>
<li>2 ½ cups <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BY8MCBQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">masa harina</a></li>
<li>1 ½ cups + 2 tablespoons warm water</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>2 cups refried black beans (Ducal brand is good or make your own)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>vegetable oil for pan frying</li>
<li>For serving:</li>
<li>shredded romaine lettuce</li>
<li>Mexican crema or sour cream</li>
<li>optional: pomegranate seeds</li>
<li>Jicama, Radish and Orange Salad, guacamole, or salsa of your choice, or a squeeze of lime juice</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Put the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute the onion and garlic for 1 minute. Add the sweet potatoes, jalapeno, cumin, chili powder, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until the sweet potatoes are fully tender. Mix in the lime juice. Taste and adjust seasoning; they will likely need more salt. Feel free to make the filling spicier if that suits you.</li>
<li>Mix the masa harina with the warm water and ¼ teaspoon salt. Beat with a wooden spoon until smooth. If the dough is very stiff and crumbly, beat in a few tablespoons of warm water.</li>
<li>Add the refried beans and baking powder; use your hands to mix thoroughly. Taste and add more salt if needed. (The dough can be refrigerated overnight at this point if you like).</li>
<li>Heat 1/8" of oil in a large skillet over a medium-high flame. Make golf-ball sized balls of the dough and pat them between your hands into a pancake about 1/4" thick. Fry for about 3 minutes on each side until brown on the outside and cooked but still soft on the inside.</li>
<li>Serve immediately, on a bed of shredded lettuce, topped with a generous amount of the sweet potato filling, and garnished with the crema and optional pomegranate seeds. Pass the salad, salsa, or guacamole on the side.</li>
</ol>
