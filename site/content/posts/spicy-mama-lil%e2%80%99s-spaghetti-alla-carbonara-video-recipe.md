Most of the <a href="/videos/" target="_blank">videos</a> I've posted so far have been recipes from the <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">cookbook</a>, but not this one. In fact, the recipe for this <a href="/2011/11/spicy-mama-lils-spaghetti-carbonara-recipe/" target="_blank">spicy vegetarian carbonara</a> is on the blog just back in November. I wanted to take advantage of <a href="http://chefshop.com/About-Us-W8C207.aspx">Tim's</a> outstanding videography to show you exactly how to make it. It is easy to do, but there is a certain amount of timing involved in the crucial step where the pasta is tossed with the eggs, and the video really captures it.

By the way, I'll sometimes make a one-egg version of this using a single serving of leftover pasta, just being sure to thoroughly reheat it in the skillet. It is one of my favorite late night fresses.
