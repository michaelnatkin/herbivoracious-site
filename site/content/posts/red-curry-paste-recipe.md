<p>There is nothing wrong with making curries using pre-packaged pastes, but making curry paste from scratch is addictive; the volatile aroma and flavor is at a completely different level.</p>
<p>This version of a red curry paste originated with my friend Ivy Manning, who writes wonderful cookbooks. I’ve changed it only a bit, to use ingredients I most often have on hand.</p>
<p>The great thing is, this recipe makes more paste than you will probably use in a single meal. Freeze the excess and you will have the beginning of two or three great dishes waiting for you at a moment's notice, like the Red Curry Delicata Squash on  or the Red Curry Fried Rice on .</p>

<p><strong>Red Curry Paste</strong>
<br /><em>Vegan and gluten-free / Yields enough for 2 meals</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>6 dried New Mexico chile pods, stems removed</li>
<li>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
<li>several grinds black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
<li>2-inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
<li>1/4 cup roughly chopped red onion</li>
<li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
<li>zest and juice of 1 lime</li>
<li>1 stalk lemongrass, tender white parts only, pounded and roughly chopped</li>
<li>1 big handful of cilantro, leaves and stems (rinsed)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Wearing rubber gloves, tear the chile pods into small pieces. If you like your curries hot, keep the seeds and ribs. If not, throw them out.</li>
<li>Set up your blender and put the chile pieces in the jar. Pour ½ cup boiling water over them, cover, and let sit 20 minutes or so. In the meantime, you can gather the rest of your ingredients.</li>
<li>Toast the coriander seeds for 2 minutes in a dry skillet over medium heat.</li>
<li>Add the seeds and all of the remaining ingredients to the blender. Puree for several minutes, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides and top. If needed, add a little more water to get the paste to come together.</li>
</ol>
