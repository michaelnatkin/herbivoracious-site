Last night I suddenly wanted a soft-boiled egg, and once I was in the kitchen, my evil twin took over for a few minutes and made this. </p>  <p>I know it seems like some sort of fusion nightmare, but when you are under the weather, sometimes strange things sound good. I could trace the stream of associations for you, but it probably wouldn't be that interesting.</p>  <p>Actually, please add a comment and tell us the weirdest thing you ever craved when you were sick!<br /><div class="recipe-card">
