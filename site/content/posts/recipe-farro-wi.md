It has been all over the blogosphere lately, but I had no idea it was vegetarian until <a href="http://savvysavorer.blogspot.com/">Keren</a> brought some to give away to our last food blogger get together. I shouldn't have been surprised, as processed bacon bits are a soy product too. I generally don't cook with artificial flavors, but I took it as a challenge to use it at least once, and I have to admit I liked the results. </p>  <p>Greens are often cooked with pork in both the American south and in Italy as well. I had some beautiful pearled farro that I brought home from our Italy trip, so a plan came together for a simple and hearty one-pot meal. </p>  <p>If you haven't used farro before, I really recommend you try some. It is a very ancient whole grain, one of the staples of the Roman poor. I find the flavor somewhere between wheat and barley. It is a very nice change of pace from rice and couscous.</p>  <p>This recipe is vegetarian but not vegan because the bacon salt contains milk products of some sort.</p>  <p><strong>Farro with Collard Greens and Bacon Salt</strong><br /><em>Serves 4</em></p>  <ul><li>4 servings of farro (see below)</li>  <li>1/2 small can chickpeas, drained</li>  <li>3 big bunches of collard greens or other strong-flavored greens (not spinach)</li>  <li>1 white onion, diced</li>  <li>6 T. extra virgin olive oil</li>  <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced thinly</li>  <li>1 t. chili flakes</li>  <li>1 t. Bacon Salt (or regular salt and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a>)</li></ul>  <ol><li>Cook 4 servings of farro according to package directions. (Actually you should probably make 6 servings because serving sizes are always too small, right!). There are a number of different types with different cooking times, so it is better if I don't give you specific details, but cook until it is tender but not falling apart. Drain, and stir in chickpeas.</li>  <li>Remove stems from greens, rinse thoroughly and chop coarsely</li>  <li>In a large soup pot, fry the onions in 2 T. of the oil. When slightly brown, add the chili flakes and garlic and fry for 20 more seconds.</li>  <li>Add the greens and a small splash of water if they aren't wet. Cover. After a minute or two, reduce heat to medium low. Stir occasionally until they are very thoroughly tender and wilted.</li>  <li>Remove from, drain excess water, and toss with the remaining olive oil and the Bacon Salt.</li>  <li>To serve, simply put the farro in a bowl or on a plate, top with the greens, and lightly toss. Pass more good olive oil, sea salt, bacon salt, and black pepper at the table.</li></ol>
