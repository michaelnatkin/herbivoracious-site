<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Indian-style cabbage you can make in 5 minutes</span>

This cabbage side dish is great to have in your arsenal, because it comes together in 5 minutes flat, and makes a big and flavorful addition to an Indian meal. I break out some variation of it when I'm making a curry, rice and raita and feel the need for one more dish to round out the meal.

Everything in the cabbage family (brassica) goes great with mustard, so mustard seeds are the primary flavoring. If you happen to have mustard oil, you can use that instead of the vegetable oil and reduce the seeds by half. Be sure and have all of chopping done and your spices measured in advance, because once the mustard seeds hit the oil, you have to move quickly.

	<li>1/2 head green cabbage, cored and sliced into 1/4" wide ribbons</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter), or mustard oil, or more to taste</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000JMAXMY/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">black mustard seeds</a></li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>optional: garlic, ginger, unsweetened shredded coconut, fresh chilis or dried chili flakes, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;bbn=16310101&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;keywords=garam%20masala&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1351713480&amp;rh=n%3A16310101%2Ck%3Agaram%20masala%2Cp_85%3A2470955011&amp;sort=price&amp;tag=vegfoodie-20" target="_blank">garam masala</a></li>
	<li>optional garnish: cilantro, lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Heat a large skillet or wok over a medium-high flame. Add the oil, wait 10 seconds, and immediately add the mustard seeds.</li>
	<li>As soon as they start to pop, add the rest of the spices and any optional ingredients and stir-fry for 10 more seconds. Move quickly here so you infuse the flavor in the oil but don't burn them.</li>
	<li>Add the cabbage and salt, and stir-fry until crisp-tender or tender, your preference. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
	<li>Garnish with cilantro and/or lemon juice.</li>
</ol>
