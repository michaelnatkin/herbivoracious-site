I'm a big fan of making pudding at home. It really is only slightly more work than using the stuff from a box, and you are rewarded with a wider choice in flavors and the ability to use higher quality ingredients. This maple-flavored version is a nice change of pace, and you can make the spiced pecans while the pudding sets up in the fridge. Watch the video and you'll see, I've got a surprise ingredient for spicing the pecans that adds a smokiness which matches beautifully with the woodsy maple flavor.
