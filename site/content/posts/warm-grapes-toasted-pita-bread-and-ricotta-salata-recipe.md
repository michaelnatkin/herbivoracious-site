<em>Warm Grapes, Toasted Pita Bread and Ricotta Salata</em>

I'm not sure whether to describe this dish as a salad, an appetizer, or a side dish. Whatever you call it, the combination of sweet and salty, crunchy and juicy, herbaceous and spicy is exciting and a little unusual. You could serve this as part of a meze, or an accompaniment to anything grilled in a Meditteranean or Middle Eastern vein.

Ricotta salata is a variation on fresh ricotta that has been pressed and salted. I like to use it for grating or shaving to finish a dish. It is indeed quite salty, so you don't want to eat big chunks of it, and you need to go easy on adding additional salt when using it.  If you don't have ricotta salata, feta would also work well here.

I'm hard pressed to choose a favorite set of spices to flavor this dish, so I've offered a few options below. If you twisted my arm, I'd probably pick the "fresh zaatar" variation, but try a few and and let me know which you like best.

Oh, and a bit of news: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1558327452?tag=herb-hugo-20">cookbook I'm working on</a> has had a schedule change. It will now be released by Harvard Common Press in spring 2012, rather than fall 2012 as we previously thought. I'm really excited to have it on shelves soon!
