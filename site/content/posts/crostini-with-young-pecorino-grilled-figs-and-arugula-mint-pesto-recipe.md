We got page proofs back, and there was a small window to make tweaks before it goes to press.</p> <p>A deadline like that has a way of focusing the mind! I want to make absolutely sure that every recipe in the book is as good as I can possibly make it. So I went through the whole lot and picked out a handful to test just one more time. One of them was a potato and green bean salad with arugula pesto. It occurred to me that I might like it even better with a bit of fresh mint in the pesto, and sure enough I think it makes a huge difference.</p> <p>After I made it, I had quite a bit of the pesto leftover, so I tweaked it slightly and used it to make these crostini with figs and young pecorino, which are a pretty mind bending little appetizer if I do say so myself!</p> <p>If you are only familiar with pecorino romano, which is a hard grating cheese, you should definitely seek out young pecorinos. Pecorino is the name for the entire family of Italian sheep&#39;s milk cheeses, and there are many to explore. You&#39;ll find several at Whole Foods or any good cheesemonger.</p> <p>I like to do small &quot;grilling&quot; tasks like these figs with a blowtorch. If you don&#39;t have one (or don&#39;t feel safe/comfortable using it), you could also run them under a broiler, or of course use a charcoal grill for even better flavor.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t use any toasted pine nuts in the pesto because they are <a href="/2009/02/understanding-deadly-food-allergies-this-post-could-save-a-life/" target="_blank">poison in my house</a>, but you certainly can!</p> <div class="recipe-card">
<p><strong>Crostini with Young Pecorino, Grilled Figs, and Arugula &amp; Mint Pesto</strong><br /><em>Vegetarian</em><br /><em>Yields 12 crostini&#0160;</em></p> <p><em>For the pesto:</em></p> <ul> <li>2 cups lightly packed baby arugula leaves&#0160;</li> <li>1/4 cup lightly packed fresh mint leaves</li> <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li> <li>1 clove garlic, thinly sliced</li> <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li> <li>1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Combine all ingredients in a mini food processor and process until a fairly uniform but not a completely pureed paste. Add more oil if needed to reach a consistency that is neither so thick that it stands up by itself, nor as thin as a sauce.&#0160;Taste and adjust seasoning.&#0160;</li> </ol> <ul> </ul> <p><em>For the crostini:</em></p> <ul> <li>12 thin slices of baguette, cut on the bias</li> <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li> <li>9 fresh figs</li> <li>12 fairly thin slices of young, soft pecorino cheese, each about the size of a baguette slice, at room temperature</li> <li>Flaky sea salt (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0006FS4TI/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt)</a>) or fleur de sel</li> <li>Fresh ground black pepper</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Brush the baguette slices quite generously with olive oil. Toast in a 350 degree oven until nicely browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove and cool.</li> <li>Cut the figs into quarters and brush the cut surfaces with olive oil. Grill as discussed in the headnotes, until the cut surfaces are well browned.</li> <li>To serve, put a piece of pecorino on each piece of bread. Top with 3 of the fig quarters and then mash them gently with a fork so that they will lay down and hold the pesto. Spoon a generous amount of pesto on the figs and finish with a few flakes of sea salt and a couple grinds of black pepper.</li> </ol>
