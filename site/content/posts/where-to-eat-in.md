<p>The long anticipated sixth month sabbatical is now upon your loyal author! Starting Sept. 1 we'll be traveling to Israel (Jerusalem, Tel Aviv) and Italy (Rome, Florence, and an agroturismo named Montesigliano near Sienna) for a month, and I plan to post lots of food pics from the road. I thought I'd interrupt our regularly scheduled blog to ask everyone out there for suggestions of food experiences we shouldn't miss. We are equally interested in fine dining and the best falafel or gelato stands, as well as markets, bakeries, wineries, and artisanal producers. And of course bonus points for places that you've had good vegetarian experiences at, or that will be nice to Mini-Me and tolerate the occasional screech of joy. If you have any suggestions, please add them as comments below, and thanks a million!</p>
