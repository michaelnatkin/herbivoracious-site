It is truly delicious, and I&#39;d choose it in a heartbeat over the typical red rice you find nearly universally at Mexican-American restaurants.</p> <p>When I went to make it yesterday, I thought to myself &quot;now why am I cooking all of these delicious fresh herbs?&quot; Their flavor is so perfect when raw, why should I boil them for 20 minutes? So I took a new approach. I omitted the poblanos, and simply made a pesto-like puree of the herbs, garlic, and a little oil. After the plain rice was cooked, I stirred in the herbs right before serving.</p> <p>The result was really satisfying, with a clean, bright, summery flavor. And as you can see, the green color is very appealing on the plate.</p> <p>The recipe below calls for 2 cups of fresh herbs. My daughter and I raided the garden, and used a lot of flat-leaf parsley, oregano, and cilantro,and smaller amounts of chives, rosemary, mint and dill. You can vary it according to what you have available and what you are serving it with. Because the herbs are thoroughly pureed, you can use tenderish stems of parsley and cilantro as well as the leaves.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
