<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.perfectbloodsugar.blogspot.com">Ruth of the Perfect Blood Sugar blog</a> for the excellent suggestion to have a category for recipes that are <a href="/vegan/">vegan, or easily modifiable to be vegan</a>. I've gone back through the last 50 or so posts and added the vegan ones to that category, and I'll try and do the rest soon. Let me know if there are other categories you'd find useful.<span face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><br /> <a href="http://www.perfectbloodsugar.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><br /></a></span></span></p>
