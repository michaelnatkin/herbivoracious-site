<p>I &quot;met&quot; Ivy Manning when my wife gave me <a href="/2008/07/cherry-pumpkin/" target="_blank">her terrific first cookbook</a>. Since then, we&#39;ve become frequent visitors to each other&#39;s blogs, and we keep up on Twitter as well. (Come follow <a href="http://twitter.com/michaelnatkin" target="_blank">me</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/Ivysfeast">Ivy</a>, we&#39;d love to hear from you).</p>  <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a6321c3d970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="float: right;"><img alt="AdaptableFeast" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a6321c3d970b " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a6321c3d970b-250wi.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; width: 220px;" /></a> We&#39;ve discovered that although she&#39;s an omnivore and I&#39;m a vegetarian, our taste in food has a lot in common. Both of us love fresh, seasonal produce, preferably from local farms. And we both make dishes from all over the world, but tend to prefer fairly <strong>authentic approaches</strong>, not wild substitutions for simplicity or garish flavor combinations. </p>  <p>Naturally I&#39;ve been awaiting Ivy&#39;s <strong>next book</strong>, and now it is here. As far as I know, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1570615837?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="blank">The Adaptable Feast</a> is the first book to directly address the problem of making great meals for families that have a mix of omnivores and vegetarians or vegans. The idea was born from her own personal need; Ivy&#39;s husband is a committed vegetarian. </p>  <p>I think many families find themselves in this situation. Whether it is the <strong>cliche</strong> of a college student coming home for winter break having freshly gone veg, or a traditional Thanksgiving with a few of us herbivores mixed in, many cooks who prepare meat need ways to offer a meatless option. </p>  <p>Ivy has completely thought through each of these recipes and worked out a system for how to make one main preparation, segregate and finish a vegetarian portion and then complete the omnivorous recipe. Both groups will find that they have a delicious, flavorful, satisfying dish. You might just find the meat eaters begging for access to the vegetarian half!</p>  <p>I&#39;ve already made one recipe from the book, for a <strong>Malaysian-style red curry paste</strong>, and it was superb. I&#39;ll be posting a dish based on it in the next few days. </p>  <p>Sasquatch Books has offered a free copy of The Adaptable Feast to one lucky Herbivoracious reader.
