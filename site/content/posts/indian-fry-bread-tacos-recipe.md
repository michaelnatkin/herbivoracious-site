  name: "Indian Fry Bread Tacos"
  yield: "4"
  ingredients:
    - "For the fry bread:"
    - "3 cups flour"
    - "1 teaspoon salt"
    - "1 tablespoon baking powder"
    - "1 cup milk (and maybe a little more)"
    - "vegetable oil suitable for frying (3/4\" deep in a big skillet)"
    - "For the sauteed topping:"
    - "4 poblano peppers"
    - "2 tablespoons oil"
    - "1/2 onion, fine dice"
    - "3 cloves garlic, minced"
    - "1 pound yellow summer squash or zucchini, bite-sized cubes (about 3 medium)"
    - "kernels from 2 ears of corn"
    - "2 teaspoons Mexican oregano (Italian oregano is different, but an ok substitute)"
    - "¾ teasoon Kosher salt"
    - "For assembly:"
    - "3 cups tender cooked pinto beans (homemade or canned)"
    - "1 cup grated cheddar"
    - "1/2 cup minced white onion"
    - "1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved"
    - "2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce"
    - "1 1/2 cups guacamole"
    - "thick salsa of your choice; smoky chipotle versions are good"
  instructions:
    - "For the dough: whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Add the milk and mix with a fork until you have a shaggy mass, adding a little more milk if needed. You want dough that is just barely unsticky enough to roll out. With floured hands, knead for just a few seconds to make a big ball. Oil, cover, and set aside until you are ready to fry."
    - "For the topping: Roast the poblano peppers on a grill, under the broiler, or carefully with tongs over an open flame, until blackened and blistered all over. Set aside in a covered bowl until cool. Wearing rubber gloves, remove the skin, stem and seeds, then cut into ¼” strips. (These are called rajas in Mexican cuisine)."
    - "Heat the oil in a big skillet over a medium-high flame. Fry the the onion and garlic for 1 minute, then add the summer squash and salt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until browned; add the corn and cook 2 minutes; add the poblano strips and oregano and heat through. Taste and adjust seasoning."
    - "When ready to fry the breads (just before serving, they are best fresh), bring a skillet filled with 3/4\" of oil to 365 degrees F. Divide the dough into 4 balls and roll each one out to about 9\" in diameter. Fry one at a time until medium golden brown, flipping to cook both sides. Be careful when flipping - they are big enough that if you just flop over with a spatula it can cause a dangerous splash. I use a spatula and a spoon to control them. Remove to paper towels to drain."
    - "Put a fry bread on each plate, and top with generous portions of beans, the squash saute cheese, onion, tomatoes, lettuce, guacamole and salsa. Serve immediately."

<p>Navajo Fry Bread, and the Indian Tacos made with it, have a sad and storied past. They originated in Native American internment camps set up by the US government in the 1860s, as a way to use the very limited rations provided. Today, fry bread and Indian tacos are a proud part of the culture, served at virtually every pow-wow. And with good reason; besides the history, they are delicious.</p>
<p>(Although Native American may be considered a more diplomatic term, it is never applied to this dish. The folks that make them and eat them universally refer to them as Indian tacos.)</p>
<p>Fry bread is so much more filling than a corn tortilla that a single one of these, loaded up with flavorful toppings, makes a whole meal. If you have any dough left over, it is a treat fried up and served with powdered sugar or honey.</p>
<p>Don’t knead the dough any more than is absolutely necessary to bring it together, because you want it to remain tender. For the same reason, fry it only until lightly golden brown. We aren’t looking for a crisp shell here.</p>
<p>Be sure to read through this whole recipe first; it calls for guacamole and salsa that you have prepared or purchased in advance.</p>
