  name: "Brussels Sprouts with Seeds and Coconut"

  ingredients:
    - "3 c. brussel sprouts, trimmed and sliced thin"
    - "2 T. ghee or 1 T. butter and 1 T. oil"
    - "2 T. urad dal (optional)"
    - "1 T. black mustard seeds"
    - "2 t. black caraway seeds (regular caraway is ok in a pinch)"
    - "2 t. cumin seeds"
    - "1/2 c. shredded unsweetened coconut, toasted to light brown (I'm sure fresh would be even better)"
    - "2 t. kosher salt"
    - "2 t. jaggery or brown sugar"
    - "2 t. garam masala"
    - "fresh lime or lemon juice (to taste)"

I decided to take my sprouts in an Indian direction the other night. It is pretty simple, I just shredded them and pan fried them with black mustard, black caraway, and cumin seeds, and toasted coconut. This dish is vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free. I served it with basmati rice, aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry), cucumber raita (yogurt sauce) and papadums.</p> <p>Mustard and brussels sprouts are both in the brassica family, so the seeds really complement the flavor. The key, as always with anything in the cabbage world is not to overcook them, otherwise you will bring out unpleasant sulfury flavors.</p> <p>Fresh green chilis, ginger, garlic, or onions would all be welcome additions to this dish.</p> <p>By the way, check out <a href="http://www.tastespotting.com/profile/michaelnatkin">my page on tastespotting.com</a> for a visual index of all the photos from the site.
