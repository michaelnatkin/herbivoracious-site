<p>Do you ever read an article and have this weird feeling like the author is channeling you? Or rather channeling a version of you that writes words together real good like? <br /> </p>  <p>That's how I felt about <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2190872/">Taylor Clark's hilarious essay on Slate</a> explaining vegetarians to omnivores. He captures exactly my definition of being vegetarian (food that didn't previously have eyes), my reasons for being veg (don't like to kill things), lack of judgement about other people's personal food choices, and plea for reasonable consideration at restaurants. </p>  <p>Granted there are lots of other kinds of vegetarians (which he acknowledges) but I'm on exactly the same page as this guy. If you are too, it would be a good one to forward to friends and family who feel the need to taunt you, think you hate food, or are worried that you are near malnutrition.<br /> </p>
