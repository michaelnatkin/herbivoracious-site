We ate most of them with a simple tomato sauce. They were good but a bit on the heavy side. I haven&#39;t really mastered the art of ultra-light potato gnocchi. If you have a hot tip on how to achieve pillowy lightness, please share. </p><p>I figured that by frying the rest in butter, I could make the most of their texture. For pan-frying, I think you want a little bit of density in the dumpling. After they crisped up, I added a generous handful of baby arugula and tossed briefly, then finished with pecorino romano. Man, this is good stuff! The toasty gnocchi, nutty/bitter arugula and umami flavors of the cheese are all mellowed with the browning butter. Toasted walnuts would be a perfect addition to this dish (but <a href="/2009/02/understanding-deadly-food-allergies-this-post-could-save-a-life/" target="_blank">not in my house</a>).</p><p>Since I can&#39;t claim my gnocchi technique is spot-on yet, let me point you at this <a href="http://allthingsnice.typepad.com/tastebuddies/2008/07/pillows-of-love.html" target="_blank">very well-done visual recipe</a> from Syrie of Taste Buddies. One tip I just learned from re-reading my <a href="/2008/10/pumpkin-ravioli/" target="_blank">Paul Bertolli</a>: when &quot;forking&quot; the gnocchi, dip the tines in flour before each one. I&#39;ll try that next time. Once you&#39;ve got your gnocchi made and boiled until they float, fry them up like this:</p><div class="recipe-card">
