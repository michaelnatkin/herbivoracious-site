<em>Vegetarian Enchiladas de Mole with Mushrooms and Zucchini</em>

Mole (or, rather, moles, since there are many varieties) is <strong>shrouded in legend</strong>. The dried-chili based sauces, rich with chocolate, spices, herbs and nuts or seeds can contain up to 36 ingredients, each of which has to be individually ground and toasted over a period of days. Each family has its own secret recipe.

This is all completely valid, but you can make a basic version that is about <strong>90% as tasty in an hour</strong>. The only unusual ingredients you'll need are a couple of varieties of dried chili pepper - pasilla and ancho to be specific, and they can be found in many well-stocked groceries these days, although they are much less expensive at Mexican markets.

You'll see in the recipe, we are making enchiladas using the more traditional stovetop method, not in a casserole. But if you prefer to roll them all up and bring them up to temperature in the oven, that is feasible. The main downside is that the tortillas can get soggy.

This recipe will make a lot more mole than you need for 12 enchiladas, but you might as well make a whole batch. It will keep for a few days in the refrigerator, and it freezes well.
