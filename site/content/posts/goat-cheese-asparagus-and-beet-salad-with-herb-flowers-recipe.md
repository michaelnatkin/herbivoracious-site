The chive flowers are those purple puffballs, with an oniony flavor similar to the familiar herb. The rosemary petals are much smaller, and lighter purple but if you look closely there is one on the frontmost stalk of asparagus.</p><p>I've also been wanting to play with very thinly sliced vegetables. Thin slices create a textural surprise, allowing you to experience a familiar ingredient in a different way. Last year I made a salad with <a href="/2008/03/recipe-white-as/" target="_blank">raw white asparagus</a> shaved with a vegetable peeler. For today's version used my inexpensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VZ57C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000VZ57C" target="_blank">Benriner mandoline</a>.</p><p>I recently bought this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXZORE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001QXZORE" target="_blank">kevlar glove</a> from Microplane which makes the mandoline a lot safer to use. I don't think I could have done the asparagus so nicely without it. If you don't have those tools, you could certainly make the same dish with a sharp knife, you probably just wouldn't be able to get such even slices. But it would still look and taste delicious.</p><p> Goat cheese seemed a natural to pair with the asparagus and beets. If you have a very special chevre, you might want to leave it unmanipulated. This one was good, but I opted to roll it in toasted sesame and fennel seeds for a little additional interest. </p><p>Time permitting, I would have liked to serve a bit of a very rich, lemony hollandaise, but for today I added lemon zest and juice to storebought mayonnaise to make the sauce, along with a few drops of good balsamic.</p><div class="recipe-card">
