This one I did with raw cherry tomatoes. The water emulsified the oil, so it actually was more like a tomato dressing. It still had a lot of flavor intensity and has the virtue of coming together in 2 minutes. Dipping bread in the leftovers was pretty incredible. You should only keep leftover home-flavored oils for a few days because there is a risk of anaerobic bacteria.</p>  <p>The broth for a risotto should be mildly flavored, because it is greatly reduced and concentrated in the cooking process. If you started with a strong broth it would be overpowering when finished. For this risotto, I add the corn cobs to the broth while it is simmering to bring up the corn flavor.</p><p>p.s. I made <a href="/2009/08/roasted-tomato-and-corn-risotto-recipe/" target="_blank">another version of this dish</a> in the summer of 2009; check it out and see which sounds best to you!</p><div class="recipe-card">
<p><strong>Summery Risotto With Corn, Zucchini and Cherry Tomato Oil</strong><br /><em>Serves 6<br />Vegetarian and gluten-free; vegan if you omit the cheese</em></p>  <p>For the tomato oil:</p>  <ul> <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li> <li>handful of flavorful cherry tomatoes (or 1/4 cup diced ripe tomato)</li> <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li> </ul>  <ol> <li>Puree all ingredients in a mini-food processor.</li> <li>Allow to steep for half an hour if possible.</li> <li>Strain first through a fine mesh sieve and refrigerate if not using soon.</li> </ol>  <p>For the risotto:</p>  <ul> <li>6 cups mildly flavored vegetable broth (Seitenbacher broth powder works well)</li> <li>4 tablespoon olive oil</li> <li>1/4 cup minced onion</li>   <li>2 cups arborio, carnaroli or other risotto-approved rice</li> <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li> <li>2 teaspoons salt</li> <li>corn kernels from 1 and 1/2 ears, reserve the cobs</li> <li>2 small zucchini, fine dice</li> <li>1/2 cup or more grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese plus more for serving</li> </ul>  <ol> <li>Bring the broth to a simmer, and add the corn cobs.</li> <li>Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, heavy pot. Saute the onion for a couple of minutes until softened but not browned. Add the rice and saute for a minute or two until it turns slightly translucent.</li> <li>Add the wine and salt stir until absorbed.</li> <li>Add the broth, one ladle at a time, stirring very frequently. Continuously isn&#39;t necessary. When the rice begins to dry out, add another ladle. </li> <li>After 16 minutes, begin to check a grain every minute. When there is a slight white pinhead that is a bit tough inside, add the vegetables. If you have used up all of the broth, you can start using water. Add more salt if needed.</li> <li>Within 3-10 minutes, the rice should be tender but with just a hint of toothsomeness to it, and it should be surrounded with creamy, starchy goodness. Take it off of the heat right away and stir in the cheese.</li> <li>Serve in individual bowls. Add a good squeeze of the tomato oil around the edge, and top with more cheese. Or truffles if you happened to have some.</li> </ol>
