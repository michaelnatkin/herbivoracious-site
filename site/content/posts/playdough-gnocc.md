Mini-me and I have been working on these every morning since before we knew there was a contest, so of course we had to enter them. Does anyone have a sauce suggestion? The texture is ultra-smooth and they are oh so salty.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
<p><strong>Playdough Gnocchi </strong><em><br />Serves 2 (1 grownup and 1 munchkin)</em></p>  <ol><li>Take 1 large container of playdough (homemade or store bought), and roll out into 3/4&quot; wide ropes. We like to use all the colors kneaded to a nice neutral, but if you prefer primaries I'll understand.</li>  <li>Cut into 1&quot; lengths.</li>  <li>Hold a kitchen fork tines down on a table, with the back towards you. Take each gnocchi, and using your thumb, roll it down the fork to create the ridges, and press in to create an indentation on the opposite side.</li>  <li>Place on a non-breakable plate and serve immediately!</li></ol>
