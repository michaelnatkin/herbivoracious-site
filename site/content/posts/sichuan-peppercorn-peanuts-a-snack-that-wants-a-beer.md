recipe:
  name: "Sichuan Peppercorn Peanuts"
  yield: "220 grams"
  ingredients:
    - "3.5 grams Sichuan peppercorns"
    - "2 grams coriander seed"
    - "1 1/2 grams ancho chili powder (or chili powder of your choice)"
    - "1 dried guajillo pepper"
    - "9 grams orange zest (see below for preparation)"
    - "35 grams neutral vegetable oil"
    - "200 grams unsalted, dry roasted peanuts"
    - "1 to 2 grams fleur de sel, or, better, Himalayan sulfur salt, ground to a powder (more to taste)"
  instructions:
    - "Finely grind the Sichuan peppercorns and coriander seed and combine with the ancho powder. Remove the seeds and stem from the guajillo chili and cut it lengthwise into 2 strips, and then slice those crosswise into the thinnest threads you can manage. Add to the spices."
    - "Cut strips of orange zest, being careful to avoid the pith, then use your knife to cut into threads similar to the chili threads. Add to the spices."
    - "Line a paper plate with towels. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the spice mixture and cook until fragrant, but don't allow to burn. Add the peanuts and cook, tossing frequently, for 2 more minutes. Remove to the paper towels, including all of the spices. Allow to drain for a few minutes, then transfer to a bowl, toss with the salt, adjust seasoning, and serve (or they will keep for a few days)."

The idea for these came from a packaged Japanese snack that I find totally addictive. It is easy to make at home, and then you can adjust the ratio of heat, orange zest, salt, and the tongue-numbing zing of the Sichuan peppercorn to your own preference. These guys pretty much have "snack with a beer" written all over them. They would also be awesome tossed with crispy, pan-fried tofu for a spicy variation on kung pao.

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071CX48ZS?tag=herb-hugo-20">Sichuan peppecorns</a> are the seed hulls (pericarps) from a tree in the citrus family. They do have a citrusy flavor, but their most prominent feature is the way they shock your tongue kind of like licking a 9-volt battery, but in a good way. The quantity I've specified in the recipe isn't large, feel free to amp it up if you find you like that zing.

You can grind the spices in a mortar and pestle, with an electric <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FL2WH8K1?tag=herb-hugo-20">coffee grinder</a>, or with a ceramic hand mill like this Hario model. The Hario is great because it lets you adjust the grind very precisely.
