The idea for these came from a packaged Japanese snack that I find totally addictive. It is easy to make at home, and then you can adjust the ratio of heat, orange zest, salt, and the tongue-numbing zing of the Sichuan peppercorn to your own preference. These guys pretty much have "snack with a beer" written all over them. They would also be awesome tossed with crispy, pan-fried tofu for a spicy variation on kung pao.

They do have a citrusy flavor, but their most prominent feature is the way they shock your tongue kind of like licking a 9-volt battery, but in a good way. The quantity I've specified in the recipe isn't large, feel free to amp it up if you find you like that zing.

You can grind the spices in a mortar and pestle, with an electric <a href="http://www.myshopping.com.au/PT--296_Small_Kitchen_Appliances_Coffee_Grinders__fs_11753_e__">coffee grinder</a>, or with a ceramic hand mill like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001802PIQ/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">Hario model</a>. The Hario is great because it lets you adjust the grind very precisely.

<strong>Sichuan Peppercorn Peanuts</strong>
Vegetarian, vegan, gluten free and kosher
Yields 220 grams  / a small bowl; multiply as needed
<ul>
	<li>3.5 grams Sichuan peppercorns</li>
	<li>2 grams coriander seed</li>
	<li>1 1/2 grams ancho chili powder (or chili powder of your choice)</li>
	<li>1 dried guajillo pepper</li>
	<li>9 grams orange zest (see below for preparation)</li>
	<li>35 grams neutral vegetable oil</li>
	<li>200 grams unsalted, dry roasted peanuts</li>
	<li>1 to 2 grams fleur de sel, or, better, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001O1Q0NA/?tag=poeticlicen07-20">Himalayan sulfur salt</a>, ground to a powder  (more to taste)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Finely grind the Sichuan peppercorns and coriander seed and combine with the ancho powder. Remove the seeds and stem from the guajillo chili and cut it lengthwise into 2 strips, and then slice those crosswise into the thinnest threads you can manage. Add to the spices. </span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Cut strips of orange zest, being careful to avoid the pith, then use your knife to cut into threads similar to the chili threads. Add to the spices.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Line a paper plate with towels. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the spice mixture and cook until fragrant, but don't allow to burn. Add the peanuts and cook, tossing frequently, for 2 more minutes. Remove to the paper towels, including all of the spices. Allow to drain for a few minutes, then transfer to a bowl, toss with the salt, adjust seasoning, and serve (or they will keep for a few days).</span></li>
</ol>
