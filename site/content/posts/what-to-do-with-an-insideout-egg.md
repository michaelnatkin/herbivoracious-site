I found these at our Farmer's Market last weekend. What a trip! The farmer said it is an heirloom breed of chicken that he's in the process of re-establishing as a breeding flock, but had just a few eggs to sell. So far I've eaten a couple <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0007M2BN0?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">just soft-boiled</a> like this, on toast. The taste is perfectly normal, except, well, inside out. Anyone have any <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0743235274?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">better ideas</a> of how to really showcase this unique find?
