recipe:
  name: "Chocolate-Cream Cheese Frosting"
  diet: "Vegan, Gluten-Free"
  ingredients:
    - "12 ounces good quality chocolate chips (Ghiradelli works well)"
    - "4 tablespoons unsalted butter"
    - "6 ounces cream cheese (I used the whipped kind, but a denser one should work fine too, just break it up into cubes), at room temperature"
    - "1/8 teaspoon salt"
  instructions:
    - "Melt the chocolate chips and butter in a double boiler or microwave. To microwave, combine in a microwave-safe bowl and cook 1 minute at a time, stopping to carefully stir in between. This is my favorite way to do it, you just have to be sure not to overcook or you can scorch it."
    - "Allow to cool a bit, so it won't cook and curdle the cream cheese."
    - "Whisk the cream cheese and salt into the melted chocolate. Keep whisking until smooth."
    - "Refrigerate for an hour or so until firm enough to spread."
    - "Yum."

The story is of a Grandpa who wants to make a cake for his wife, but has a little bit of trouble following the recipe. It is just too tempting for him to scale it up a hundred-fold or so. A delicious mess ensues.</p><p>The book ends with a (normal-scale) recipe for Whopper Cake. With my daughter&#39;s birthday approaching and the book in nightly rotation, it was obvious that we should make it for her big day. I can confirm, it makes a very moist, tasty chocolate sheet cake. You should buy this book for any kid that loves to cook with his or her family. Or any kid that loves cake.</p><p>The recipe didn&#39;t specify a frosting, but I was faced with three simple facts: (1) we had a lot of leftover cream cheese (2) my wife loves cream cheese frosting (3) cream-cheese frosting is super easy to make. Here&#39;s what I came up with:</p><div class="recipe-card">
