<em>Sichuan Spicy Cauliflower</em>

So, this happened: for reasons too tedious to explore, we ate dinner at a California Pizza Kitchen the other night. First time I've been to one in years. Not my first choice of places to eat, but it served the purpose. The very next morning, I woke up to this Google Alert in my inbox:

Yep. A guy going by the name "Herbivoracious" just reviewed a California Pizza Kitchen. In Mumbai, India. He even had the same pizza as me, the so-called "wild mushroom" (which is made entirely with cultivated mushrooms). How weird is that?

Anyhow. This is some spicy cauliflower. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;keywords=sichuan%20peppercorns&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1363586421&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Asichuan%20peppercorns&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20">Sichuan peppercorns</a> give it that nice tongue-numbing sting. The amount in the recipe is relatively low, so feel free to double that ingredient if you see fit.

This dish is good hot, but it is also pretty darn tasty cold, when it becomes almost like a spicy pickle. I cooked it sous vide, but you can just as easily microwave it. It would probably be really good if you microwaved the plain cauliflower until it was just short of tender and then stir-fried it with the spices. The way you see it in the picture, I cooked the head just cut into two halves because I thought that would look cool to slice it at the table, but honestly it would be just as good to cut into florets first - and it will cook much more quickly.
