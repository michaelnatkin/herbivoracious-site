She wants something sweet, and <strong>she wants it now</strong>. She knows that a little treat at the end of a meal makes it satisfying, memorable, special... or just gives her that extra leverage to get the kids to do the chores. Whatever the reason, she's figured out 100 recipes to get that treat on the table in 30 minutes, from desire to first bite. </p><p>Chattman doesn't shade the truth when she says 30 minutes. A lot of times when you see "quick and easy" promised, it really means 30 minutes <em>if</em> you had the forethought to make the dough the day before and chill it, or <em>if</em> you have 30 minutes to make it and can wait another hour for it to come out of the oven. None of that here. Any home cook can make and serve anything this book in the allotted time, barely breaking a sweat.</p><p>To deliver on her pledge, Chattman has developed a bunch of techniques. Some of them, like spreading a filling on (high quality) store-bought cookies seem kind of pointless to me. But others make great culinary sense, like working in smaller batches, baking in individual serving sizes (mini-muffin tins, ramekins, madeleine pans), pushing temperatures as high as possible, and cooking in non-traditional ways. I've pan-fried cookie dough before (yum!) but I never thought to do it in a waffle iron. Dang!</p><p>If you are a <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheVegetarianFoodie">regular reader of this blog</a>, you know I don't shy away from "project" recipes, but when I do need something fast before popping in Mad Men, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600850189?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1600850189">Dessert Express</a> is definitely going to get a workout.</p><p>Here is her recipe for chocolate-chili pudding cake (aka lava cake). If you haven't had one before, a pudding cake is just a cake that is intentionally underbaked a bit, so that the outside is fairly dry but the inside is still molten chocolate. See the picture above. Naturally you can omit the chili if that doesn't sound good to you.</p><div class="recipe-card">
