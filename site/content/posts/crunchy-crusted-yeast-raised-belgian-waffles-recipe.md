recipe:
  name: "Crunchy Crusted Yeast-Raised Belgian Waffles"
  yield: "4"
  time: "10 minutes"
  ingredients:
    - "2 ½ cups barely warm milk (around 100 degrees)"
    - "1 package dry yeast (2 ¼ teaspoons)"
    - "½ cup melted butter, cooled to just warm"
    - "2 eggs, lightly beaten"
    - "1 tablespoon agave nectar or honey"
    - "1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour"
    - "¼ cup rice flour"
    - "¼ cup malt powder"
    - "1 teaspoon Kosher salt"
  instructions:
    - "Put the milk in a large bowl, big enough for the batter to greatly increase in size overnight without making a mess. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk, stir, and allow to proof for 5 minutes. (If you don’t see any sign of yeast activity, your yeast may be dead.)"
    - "Stir in the melted butter, eggs, and agave nectar. The butter will clump up; that’s ok."
    - "Stir in the all-purpose flour, rice flour, salt and malt powder (if using). Mix well. The batter will be thinner than typical waffle batter. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight."
    - "In the morning, give the batter a stir. Preheat your waffle iron and cook the waffles according to the manufacturer’s instructions, being certain to bake them until quite brown for maximum flavor and the best crunchy exterior. As always, the first waffle is usually not the best, but pay close attention and adjust the time and temperature to achieve perfection."
