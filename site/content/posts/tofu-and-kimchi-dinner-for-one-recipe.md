  name: "Tofu and Kimchi Dinner for One"
  yield: "1"
  diet: "Vegan, Vegetarian, Gluten-Free"
  ingredients:
    - "1 tablespoon vegetable oil"
    - "1/3 pound extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cut into 1/2\" dice"
    - "2 tablespoons minced red onion"
    - "1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger"
    - "salt"
    - "toasted sesame oil"
    - "2 green onions (scallions), thinly sliced (white and light green parts only)"
    - "toasted sesame seeds"
    - "1/4 cup vegetarian kimchi"
    - "1 tablespoon ssamjang or 1 teaspon kochujang, or 1 teaspoon sriracha"
  instructions:
    - "Heat a large cast iron skillet over a very high flame. Add the oil, and 5 seconds later, the tofu and a great big pinch of salt. Fry, tossing occasionally until golden brown. Add the onion and grated ginger and fry for 30 more seconds."
    - "Mound the tofu into a bowl. Drizzle on a little sesame oil, and garnish heavily with the green onions and sesame seeds. Add a nice pile of kimchi and the hot sauce of your choice. I really love ssamjang because it is only moderately spicy, with a lot of flavor complexity, so you can use quite a bit of it."

<em>Tofu, kimchi and lots of garnish - dinner for one in no time flat</em>

<strong> You could be eating this in less than ten minutes and using only one pot. </strong>We had one of those nights where the kids just needed to go to bed early (know how that goes?) and I ended up making this just for myself. It took me right back to my bachelor days, when I took a lot of pleasure in making a tasty dinner for one. Much of the joy in cooking is social, but when you are the only guest, you can take advantage of cooking exactly to your own taste.

<em></em>

Oddly enough, I didn't even make rice for this meal. I just ate a lot of tofu. So sue me. But you probably might like some rice.

I wouldn't dream of making this in anything other than my <a href="/2009/11/my-skillet/" target="_blank">cast iron skillet</a>.

Of course if you do have company for dinner, you can easily multiply this recipe as needed. It could also be embellished with sauteed shiitakes, finely shredded nori, a fried egg, or a handful of sugar snap peas.

Tasty vegetarian kimchi can be a little hard to find. You have to look closely at the ingredients to see if there is shrimp paste etc. in it. One brand I like is Dae Han Tofu Company, or if you are in Seattle, keep your eye out for the non-traditional but delicious Firefly Kitchens booth at the Farmer's Markets. Good stuff.
