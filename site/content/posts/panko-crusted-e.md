<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">Panko-Crusted Egg With Cherry Smoked Asparagus, Smoked Paprika, And Sherry Gastrique</span>

This was the third course for <a href="/2008/05/dinner-party-1/">my recent "underground" dinner party</a>, and definitely my favorite. The panko-crusted egg was a late-night inspiration. I've been on a hunt for new ways to add crispy textures in unexpected places. The crunchy panko makes a really cool counterpoint to a correctly cooked, soft and smooth hardboiled egg. Eggs and asparagus have a natural affinity, and smoking the asparagus doubles up the flavor of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000NO943C/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">smoked paprika</a> (pimenton dulce). The sherry gastrique adds complex sweet/sour/caramelized notes.

<i><b>NOTE:</b> I no longer recommend jury-rigged stovetop smoking. I've since learned that creating smoke in a low-oxygen sealed environment like this creates unnecessarily high levels of carcinogens. See my <a href="/2013/01/smoked-tofu-buns-recipe/">Smoked Tofu Buns</a> recipe for a safer alternative if you don't have your own method of smoking.</i>

<strong>Panko-Crusted Egg With Cherry Smoked Asparagus, Smoked Paprika, And Sherry Gastrique</strong>
<em>Serves 4
Vegetarian, not vegan or gluten-free</em>
<ul>
	<li>4 eggs (3 for boiling, 1 for battering)</li>
	<li>cornstarch</li>
	<li>panko</li>
	<li>oil for shallow frying</li>
	<li>smoked Spanish paprika</li>
	<li>1 c. sherry vinegar (<a type="amzn">"O" brand is good</a>)</li>
	<li>1/2 c. sugar</li>
	<li>24 fat spears asparagus</li>
	<li>Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt) salt or other finishing salt</li>
	<li>extra-virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>Hard boil, chill, and peel 3 of the eggs. At the <a href="/2008/04/recipe-sabich-/">bottom of this article</a> (just above the recipe) you'll find directions for how to get them to come out tender and perfect. You only need 2 eggs to serve 4 people, but I'm having you do an extra one in case one cracks or gives you a hard time removing the shell.</li>
	<li>Reduce the sugar, sherry, and a pinch of salt over a moderate flame until it will lightly coat a spoon when allowed to cool for a minute.</li>
	<li>Trim the asparagus to uniform 3 inch lengths and lightly peel the stems. Blanch for 2 minutes in boiling, salted water then shock in ice water. Smoke however you like (e.g. in a <del datetime="2014-07-23T04:19:33+00:00">stovetop smoking set up</del> See note on safer smoking above., or on a barbeque with real charcoal and wood chips). I used cherry wood, which has a very distinctive taste. About 10 minutes should do it.</li>
	<li>Cut the eggs in half lengthwise, and batter the outside in the usual way - dipping first in cornstarch, then a raw beaten egg, then panko mixed with some salt. Try not to get any batter on top of the egg. Pan-fry in about 1/2" of oil until crispy.</li>
	<li>Reheat the asparagus with a very quick saute in a bit of olive oil at high heat.</li>
	<li>To serve, put a circular dusting of the pimenton on the plate and top with the egg. Next to that, put down a teaspoon or so of the gastrique. Place 6 spears of the smoked asparagus on top of that in a pyramid.</li>
	<li>Hit the asparagus with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and finishing salt.</li>
</ol>
