    - "1 whole head garlic, peeled and minced"
    - "1 carrot, finely diced"
    - "1 teaspoon salt"

    - "Stove-top method: In a large pot, soak and cook the beans as usual, reserving 7 cups of the bean cooking liquid when finished. Saute the vegetables as above."
    - "Add the bean broth, bay leaves, rosemary and your choice of the parmesan rind, dried porcini, or broth powder. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes. Add the beans and then do step 4 above."
