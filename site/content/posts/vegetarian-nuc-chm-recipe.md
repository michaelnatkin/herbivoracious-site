<p>Nước chấm is the quintessential Vietnamese dipping sauce made of fish sauce seasoned with sugar, lime juice, garlic and chiles. I use a little bit of kombu and soy sauce to infuse that oceanic, umami flavor that would otherwise be missing.</p>
<p>Serve this with the Bánh xèo, or as an alternative to of the ginger-grapefruit sauce with Bun,</p>
