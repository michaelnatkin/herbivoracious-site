That was the case with this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/magazine/15FOOD.html" target="_blank">Gâteau de Crêpes</a> from Amanda Hesser in the New York Times magazine back in 2005. The idea is simple enough: <strong>twenty layers of crepes</strong> filled with whip-cream lightened pastry cream, finished with a layer of bruleed sugar.&#0160;</p>  <p>Still, I knew that plenty could go wrong. Would those layers really stay together and line up neatly? What should be the density of the pastry cream so that it wouldn&#39;t collapse under the weight of the crepes and a knife, but still be <strong>suave</strong>?</p>  <p>I finally sucked it up and made it for my own birthday party and it turned out pretty darn tasty, if a bit sloppy looking on the outside. The inside was beautiful. Of course I had to put my own spin on it. I went with alternating layers of <strong>chocolate pastry cream</strong> and <strong>dulce de leche</strong>. As you can see, my fears of seepage were well founded, but who really cared? It was rich and delicious; a small slice would be perfectly satisfying. I had three. </p>  <p>&#0160;<a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340128764c7aa2970c-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GateauxDeCrepes1" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340128764c7aa2970c " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340128764c7aa2970c-500wi.jpg" /></a> <br /> </p>  <p>The recipe in Hesser&#39;s article covers it fine, so there is no need to go over it here. If you want to make my variation, just add 6 ounces of high quality <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01ID73TR2?tag=herb-hugo-20">dark chocolate</a> (something in the 72% range) to the hot pastry cream, and a jar of homemade or store-bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000SRJLSW?tag=herb-hugo-20">dulce de leche</a> for the alternate layers. You&#39;ll want to warm the dulce de leche and maybe thin it with a bit of cream as well so you can spread it <strong>without destroying the crepes</strong>.</p>  <p>Oh, and I&#39;m not sure why she has you heat the milk for the crepe batter. I&#39;ve always used Julia Child&#39;s recipe from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0375413405?tag=herb-hugo-20">Mastering The Art of French Cooking</a>, which doesn&#39;t call for that, and I&#39;ve never had a problem with the results. Feel free to skip it.</p>  <p>If you have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">pressure cooker</a> and haven&#39;t used it to make dulce de leche, I highly recommend it. Works beautifully.</p>
