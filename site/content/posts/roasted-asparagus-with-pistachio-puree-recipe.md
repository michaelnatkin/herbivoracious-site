At <a href="http://sitkaandspruce.com/">Sitka and Spruce and Bar Sajor</a>, Matt Dillon serves quite a few salads and small plates with a base of various ridiculously good nut purees. Though really, puree isn't quite the right word. They eat more like a sort of nut-based hummus: rich, creamy, slightly fluffy, but packed full of the flavor of roasted nuts.

At <a href="http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/dairy-free-pistachio-gelato">ChefSteps</a>, the kitchen recently did some development work with the American Pistachio Growers, and so we've had vast quantities of great pistachios around. Which is basically kryptonite for me, if kryptonite was really delicious and made you super happy when you ate it.

I didn't exactly need my Nancy Drew Junior Sleuth Kit to put those two clues together.

I wrote the recipe below exactly as I did it, but I suspect it would also work in a food processor. I also suspect you could just put all the ingredients in at once, rather than drizzling in the oil and water, and that you could probably use less oil. You could certainly play with the flavor profile. I opted for lemon juice, garlic, cumin, and smoked paprika but it could just as easily be orange juice and zest and, say, ras el hanout. Whatever you do, don't overpower the flavor of the pistachios - they should be the stars.

This recipe will make more that you need for one bunch of asparagus; it is probably about the smallest amount you can easily make in a blender though. I don't think you'll be too sorry having extra around. It would go equally great with raw endive or roasted cauliflower.
