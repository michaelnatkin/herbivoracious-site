The reality isn&#39;t so violent, they have actually just been poached directly in a thin salsa.&#0160;</p><p>Let me go ahead and state the obvious: this is great hangover food.</p><p>I&#39;m pretty much a sucker for anything involving poached eggs, especially if there is something good to sop up the runny yolk. In this case it mixes in with the sauce and you wipe it all up with a stack of soft corn tortillas. </p><p>I first learned of Huevos Ahogados from my beloved <a href="/2008/01/review-senor-mo/" target="_blank">Senor Moose</a>, which I don&#39;t get to visit nearly enough because it is all the way across town in Ballard. To my surprise it wasn&#39;t in any of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0609603558?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">Diana Kennedy</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061373265?tag=herb-hugo-20">Rick Bayless</a> cookbooks I have. Senor Moose uses a tomato broth, but I had tomatillo salsa left from the <a href="/2009/02/swiss-chard-enchiladas-in-a-tomatillo-sauce-recipe/" target="_blank">Swiss chard enchiladas</a> of my previous post, so I used that. I think either version is delicious. You could also use a jarred salsa. Puree it if is chunky. </p><p>(By the way, the reason my tomatillo salsa isn&#39;t green is I used pinto bean cooking broth to thin it, and it turned it brown. Not so pretty, but it tastes great.)</p><p>One nice bonus about this dish: if you have ever had trouble poaching eggs, it won&#39;t be a problem here. The salsa has enough body to keep the whites in a compact ball around the yolks. </p><p>Hmm, that makes me wonder... maybe I could invent an easy egg poaching technique using xanthan gum! To the kitchen, batman.... but first:</p><div class="recipe-card">
