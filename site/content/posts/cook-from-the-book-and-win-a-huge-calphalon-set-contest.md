<em>Win me?</em>

My whole dream <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">with the cookbook</a> is that it is one people will use on a regular basis. I wanted to share recipes with you that are <strong>manageable to make, and delicious enough to keep making</strong>. So I get really excited when people write back to tell me what they've made and how they liked it.

I thought it would be fun to turn that into a contest. All you have to do is cook something, anything, from my book and take a picture of it. Then jump over to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/herbivoracious/app_95936962634">Contests tab</a> on my facebook page and follow the steps to upload your photo. This is <strong>not a photography contest, so don't worry about taking a beautiful photo.</strong> There will be voting for which dish people would most like to try, not which is the technically best picture, and then I'll pick the winner at random from the top 10 vote getters.

I think the winner is going to be <strong>really happy</strong>, because Calphalon has offered to sponsor the contest and provide one heck of a nice prize: an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0028SEOOU?tag=herb-hugo-20">8 piece Unison non-stick cookware set</a> (2 sizes of omelette pan, a saucepan, a saute pan, and a stock pot, plus all the lids) and a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000IV6LHW?tag=herb-hugo-20">7 piece nylon and wooden utensil</a> set suitable for use in the non-stick pots.

Here's the contest timeline:

Today thru June 4, 2012 (at midnight PDT) - entries accepted
June 4 - June 11 - public voting
June 12 - winner chose at random from among the top 10 vote getters

So get out there and cook a recipe from the book and enter the contest, then ask all of your friends to vote for your entry! Let's make this fun and best of luck to everyone. I can't wait to see what you make!
