These pods were about 8 inches long, with&#0160;<strong>ruffled leaves</strong>, somewhat crunchy like romaine lettuce, but with a central seed pod a bit like a green bean. Most unusual.</p> <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834015433c528ed970c-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="display: inline;"><img alt="WingedBean" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb8834015433c528ed970c" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834015433c528ed970c-500wi.jpg" title="WingedBean" /></a><br /><em>Photo courtesy of Terri at <a href="http://hungerhunger.blogspot.com/2008/12/linda-s-four-winged-bean-salad.html" target="_blank">HungerHunger</a></em></p> <p>My policy is to <strong>always buy an unknown fruit or vegetable</strong>, on the assumption that the web will help me figure out what it is and how to use it. The gentleman I bought them from said to eat them raw, but an initial skeptical bite showed that to be a fairly unappealing prospect.</p> <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb883401538fa43cf6970b-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="float: right;"><img alt="Winged Beans at Market" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb883401538fa43cf6970b" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb883401538fa43cf6970b-200wi.jpg" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Winged Beans at Market" /></a>Asking around on the social media,&#0160;<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/@kitsune_shoujo" target="_blank">@kitsune_shoujo</a>&#0160;from Singapore, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/herbivoracious/posts/214620205243483" target="_blank">Ananthi Parkin</a> from Malaysia informed me right away that this vegetable is kacang botol, or winged bean, and that they it could be used in a variety of stir-fried dishes, or cooked and chilled for a salad.</p> <p>Here&#39;s my first try at a recipe using them with what I found in our rental house kitchen. I thought it was pretty darn tasty. This is a pretty basic method for a stir-fry flavored with garlic and tomatoes that you could adapt to green beans or okra, for example. In the heat of the very rapid stir-fry, the tomatoes begin to break down and create a bit of sauce, which is enhanced with soy sauce and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005WXMPMQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">toasted sesame oil</a>.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
