Probably reading the completely insane <a asin="0060817577" type="amzn">El Bulli book</a> that Sarina got me for Hannukah, although I certainly don't mean to invite any comparisons! Anyhow I was thinking about how many different forms grapes can take, and that made me want to pair several of them with cheese on the same plate. And then I've also been germinating ideas of dishes that combine or contrast industrially processed and &quot;normal&quot; foods. Not necessarily in an ideological way, not to make fun of the processed food, but just to let it speak for itself. </p>  <p>Anyhow, here is what I came up with for a first try:</p>  <ol><li>Feta with quickly sauteed grapes, olive oil, and <a asin="B000V9ESIA" type="amzn">fennel pollen</a></li>  <li>Morbier&nbsp; with cubes of wine gelee (made with agar agar so as to be vegetarian)</li>  <li>Shards of pecorino romano with 15 year aged balsamic vinegar</li>  <li>Kraft singles with Welch's grape jelly on a Ritz cracker</li></ol>  <p> By the way, if you like this post, please <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=/blog/2007/12/cheese-and-grap.html&title=Cheese%20and%20Grapes%20Four%20Ways">give it a Thumbs Up on StumbleUpon</a>... thanks!</p>
