My Dad is in town, and we were wandering around the wilds of Ballard when he declared his hunger. Immediately my mental food tracking GPS went in to gear, and said &quot;<a href="http://www.senormoose.com/index.html">Senor Moose</a>!! I haven't been to Senor Moose in far too long!&quot;</p>  <p>The Moose is one of the most amazing restaurants in the Seattle area. When you walk in, you feel like you are in a humble backroads diner, with cozy but rustic furniture. You would think that this is going to be a pleasant ham-and-eggs joint, but then you notice all of the Mexican decorations, and you hope against hope, maybe there will be huevos rancheros too.</p>  <p>Oh, dear hungry sir or madam, you have not dared to dream big enough. Open your eyes, and you will find yourself rewarded with Calabacitas Guisadas (zucchini, corn, and onion stew from Michoacan, $8.75), Papas Con Rajas (poblano chilis and potatoes in cream, from Mexico City, $7.95), the Huevos Con Nopalitos pictured above (eggs with fresh cactus paddles, black beans and cotija cheese, and corn tortillas, $7.95), or the magnificient Huevos Ahogados (poached eggs &quot;drowning&quot; in a tomato broth, $7.95).</p>  <p>And that just begins to scratch the surface of the menu. Out of a tiny kitchen, owner Kathleen Andersen and chef Abraham Mata offer dozens of regional specialties from all over Mexico. Kathleen lived and traveled throughout Mexico for decades, and collected recipes from every abuela and tia she was lucky enough to spend time with.</p>  <p>Vegetarians as well as carnivores will find plenty of options, though the menu might be a bit tough for vegans. <br /> </p>  <p>If you have any of the cookbooks of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0609603558?tag=herb-hugo-20">Diana Kennedy</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0061373265?tag=herb-hugo-20">Rick Bayless</a> (or have eaten at his restaurants), you will be amazed to find the same level of authenticity and flavor in an inexpensive joint in Ballard.</p>  <p>The menu also includes some American-style breakfast items, and more familiar tacos and enchiladas for those who aren't in the mood to stretch their culinary horizons first thing in the morning. Dad was really happy with his Havarti, Mushroom and Spinach scramble ($7.95).</p>  <p>Breakfast is offered from 8:00 - 3:00 everyday, and dinner starts at 5:00, running until 9:00 on weekdays and 10:00 on Friday and Saturday.<br /> </p>      <p>   <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/5543/Seattle/Ballard-restaurants/Senor-Moose.html"><img width="200" height="146" alt="Senor Moose in Seattle" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/5543/biglink.gif" /></a></p>
