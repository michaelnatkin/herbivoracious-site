We spotted them from a few booths away at the farmer&#39;s market, and even though we have several rows of potatoes growing at home, we had to have them. I know it is hard to see the scale, but each one was just a bit bigger than a large marble.</p><p>On the same day, I found this puntarelle (the leafy green you see in the picture). It looks a bit different than any pictures I found on the web with the same name. Possibly it was younger. Apparently it is in the chicory family. Certainly quite bitter, to the point where I wouldn&#39;t really eat it raw.</p><p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a596408a970c-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="float: right;"><img alt="Tiny_Potatoes" class="at-xid-6a00e008d618bb88340120a596408a970c " src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb88340120a596408a970c-pi.jpg" style="margin: 5px; width: 230px;" title="Tiny_Potatoes" /></a>This wilted salad was my idea of how to pair these two beautiful ingredients. I added radishes, which accentuate the sharpness of the greens, creamy Teleme cheese and roasted garlic to tame them, and peaches and fine <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CFY4F?tag=herb-hugo-20">balsamico</a> for a bit of sweetness. Toasted walnuts would be an excellent addition. Another soft cheese, a blue cheese or even feta could replace the Teleme </p><p>This same concept could be applied to other bitter greens, especially in the chicory family (escarole, radicchio, etc). If it was a head type instead of individual leaves, grilling would be a fine option.</p><p><strong>Salad of Wilted Puntarelle, Tiny Potatoes and Teleme</strong><br /><em>Serves 4<br />Vegetarian and gluten-free; vegan if you omit the cheese</em></p><ul> <li>1 head of garlic</li> <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li> <li>2 cups tiny potatoes (or cut up larger ones)</li> <li>1 bunch of puntarelle, tough part of the stem removed</li> <li>1 peach, peeled and cut into 8 sections</li> <li>4 small pieces of Teleme cheese, room temperature</li> <li>8 small radishes</li> <li>8 slices of baguette</li> <li>salt</li> <li>balsamico</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Slice the top 1/8&quot; off the top of the head of garlic, wrap in tin foil, and roast in the oven or toaster oven at 375 F. for 30 minutes or until tender.</li> <li>In a large skillet, heat the 1/4 cup of olive oil over a medium-high flame.
