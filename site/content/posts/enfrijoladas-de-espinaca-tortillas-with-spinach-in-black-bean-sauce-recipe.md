Pacific Natural Foods invited me and four other bloggers to participate, and this time we were to use one of their creamy soups, and spinach.</p> <p><strong>After you check out this post, please <a href="http://everydaychefchallenge.com/recipe-gallery/?round=all" target="_blank">jump over to their site and vote</a>!  It takes just a few seconds; you don't have to register or anything,  and you can vote every 24 hours if you like. I'm in the middle of the top row. I would dearly love to win the two-day bootcamp at the Culinary Institute of America, so your vote means a lot to me!</strong></p> <p>Enfrijoladas are a simple, homey Mexican dish that you rarely see in the Unites States. Corn tortillas are dipped in a smooth bean sauce spiked with a few chiles. In the simplest form, they are simply served up with more of the sauce and some cheese or crema.</p> <p>For a slightly more elaborate version, enfrijoladas can be filled. A quick mixture of seasoned spinach and onions works great. Think of them like spinach enchiladas with beans instead of tomatos or tomatillos as the backbone of the sauce.</p> <p>Pacific Natural's Spicy Black Bean Soup is already the perfect consistency and flavor to use for enfrijoladas. This makes the whole thing so simple you can throw it together in fifteen minutes.</p> <p>I hope you like the dish, and please <a href="http://everydaychefchallenge.com/recipe-gallery/?round=all" target="_blank">go vote at the Everyday Chef Challenge</a>!</p> <p><em>Full disclosure: Pacific Natural Foods is an advertiser on my  site,  and provided products for me and the other bloggers participating  in this  contest.</em></p> <div class="recipe-card">
