The easiest dough to work with is called pâte sablée. Here is a <a href="http://www.foodbeam.com/2007/09/19/reussir-la-pate-sucree-pas-a-pas-mastering-pate-sucree-step-by-step/">detailed introduction</a> to it from my friend Fanny. Once you've made the dough and chilled it, roll it out to exactly fit a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00008T960?tag=herb-hugo-20">Silpat</a> lined baking sheet, and make a little paper template to divide the dough evenly into rectangles before baking.</p>  <p>The raspberry powder is made from these <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DBR33M8L?tag=herb-hugo-20">freeze-dried raspberries</a> that we keep around as a snack, quickly pounded in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CRHP5G3P?tag=herb-hugo-20">mortar and pestle</a> (if Amazon is out, you can often find them at Whole Foods). Keep them in the freezer and they won't absorb moisture. I'm thinking there are lots of other interesting applications for this stuff. The same brand makes many other freeze dried fruits and vegetables, all with a single ingredient and no preservatives. How about a powdered fruit salad? What would happen if we folded the powder into yogurt or cream?</p>
