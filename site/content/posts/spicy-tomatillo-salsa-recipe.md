Most people are familiar with it, but never make it. We think it only comes in jars or somehow magically appears at Mexican restaurants. It actually is ridiculously easy to do at home and tastes way better than the pre-packaged version. Once you&#39;ve got it, you can serve it at the table with any Mexican dish or as a dip for tortillas, <a href="/2009/02/huevos-ahogados-drowned-eggs-recipe/" target="_blank">fry eggs in it</a>, or use it as a sauce for enchiladas verde.</p><p>Let me introduce you to the tomatillo. You guys should be friends. You know, those green things that look like a tomato, usually in the &quot;specialty produce&quot; part of your grocery? Wrapped in a papery husk? Go buy 8 or 10 of them, around 1.5 pounds. You can thank me later.</p><p>The version of green salsa below uses a pan-roasting technique, but you can also boil the tomatillos whole, or oven roast, and you can optionally fry the finished sauce in some oil to deepen and intensify the flavors. I&#39;ve gone for a pretty garlicky hit and medium heat, but you can certainly add other herbs (cilantro, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQ8PF6MC?tag=herb-hugo-20">epazote</a>, oregano), or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014CVT6C?tag=herb-hugo-20">chipotles</a> if you want a smoky spice, or just more serrranos or jalapenos for a biger kick. <br /><div class="recipe-card">
