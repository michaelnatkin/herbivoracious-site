Romesco is a wonderful Spanish sauce made from roasted red peppers, tomatoes, roasted garlic and toasted nuts. It can be used as a party dip or spread, served as part of a tapas-style meal, stirred into mayonaise, slathered onto a sandwich...

Romesco is typically thickened with bread, but I wanted a thinner consistency for the dish you see in the picture (with gigandes beans, saffron broth, potatoes and leeks), so I omitted it. If you want thicker romesco, toast or pan-fry one slice of rustic bread and include it with the rest of the ingredients in the blender. (That dish was my contribution to our weekly culinary challenge over on the <a href="http://forum.chefsteps.com/discussion/206/culinary-challenge-2-vegetarian-main-course/p1" target="_blank">ChefSteps forums</a>.) 

Update, 2/13/2013 - we've got a <a href="http://www.chefsteps.com/activities/gigandes-beans-with-romesco-in-saffron-broth" target="_blank">video for the whole recipe</a> up at ChefSteps now. Scroll down the page for a video of the subrecipes inlcuding this romesco.

Almonds or hazelnuts are most commonly used. I went with all hazelnuts, and amped up the flavor using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000D9MRC?tag=herb-hugo-20">roasted hazelnut oil</a>. If you happen to have that available, it is aromatic and wonderful. Hazelnut oil makes incredible salad dressings too. And if not, the romesco will still be great with extra-virgin olive oil.

I was in the mood to roast the peppers with a blowtorch. It is fast, and you get a very even blistering of the skin. The flesh doesn't get cooked as much, leaving a fresher flavor that I quite like. But you can just as well use a more traditional method - see this <a href="/2012/03/polenta-with-pepperonata-recip/">Polenta with Pepperonata</a> recipe for the technique.
