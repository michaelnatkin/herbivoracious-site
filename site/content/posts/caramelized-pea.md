  name: "Caramelized Pear \"Cupcakes\" With Blue Cheese Frosting"
  yield: "6"
  ingredients:
    - "1/2 lb. homemade or frozen all-butter puff pastry"
    - "2 ripe but still firm pears"
    - "1 T. sugar"
    - "2 t. smoked spanish pimenton de la vera (dulce) paprika"
    - "1/4 c. Pena Azul Gorgonzola dolce or other blue cheese"
    - "1/2 c. cream cheese"
    - "1 T or so lemon juice"
    - "red Hawaiian Alaea sea salt for garnish"
    - "butter"
  instructions:
    - "Preheat oven to 350 and butter 6 spots in a mini-muffin tin"
    - "Slice the pears about 3/16\" thick, skipping the core"
    - "Find a couple circle cutters the approximate size of the top and bottom of your muffin tin. Cut 6 small and 6 larger circles of pear. You'll have lots of pear leftover to eat."
    - "Heat a skillet on medium, add a bit of butter, and after it melts, sprinkle in the sugar. Add the pear slices and cook a few minutes on each side, til nicely caramelized."
    - "Again with the circle cutters, cut 6 small and twelve larger circles of puff pastry."
    - "Put a small piece of puff pastry in each muffin tin, top with a slice of pear, and add a pinch of the paprika. Repeat, and finish with a layer of pastry."
    - "Bake about 15-17 minutes until golden brown"
    - "To make the icing, just warm both cheese in the microwave for 30 seconds or so until beatable, add the lemon juice, and go at it with a small whisk until smooth. Don't put any salt in the icing because you want to be able to garnish with it. Taste and adjust."
    - "Cool the cupcakes, remove from muffin tins, and pipe on the icing with a pastry bag or cut the corner off a small ziplock. Top with a few grains of the red salt."

And then I was thinking of a great post (that I can't seem to find) that Dana had over at <a href="http://tastingmenu.com">tastingmenu.com</a> about a meal she prepared that was all sweet savories and savory sweets. I love the idea of that. Here's my first try at this concept. I used puff pastry and caramelized the pears in a skillet, making alternating layers. Then I added <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000LULFJ4?tag=herb-hugo-20">smoked Spanish paprika (pimenton dulce)</a> and baked them in mini muffin tins. For the icing I mixed about 1/3 Pena Azul (a Spanish blue cheese) with 2/3 plain cream cheese and a bit of lemon juice, and topped them with a few grains of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000CC5EVG?tag=herb-hugo-20">red Hawaiian Alaea sea salt</a>. Verdict: pretty good, not bad for a first try at a totally new area of cooking for me. Definitely fun but I think the flavors need a bit of refinement. Also I bet using phyllo instead of puff pastry would be appealing. I didn't have mini parchment cupcake wrappers, but that would add to the effect, and clearly I should take more care in piping out the frosting. I think the Pena Azul is too salt, I think I would try a Gorgonzola Dolce instead. You could serve them an appetizer with a good sherry. Here's an approximate recipe:</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
