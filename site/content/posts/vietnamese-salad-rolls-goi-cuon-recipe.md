I've always loved Vietnamese Salad rolls (gỏi cuốn), and I've been making them off and on for decades, so I don't know why I haven't shared them with you guys before. If you haven't had them, they are cool and refreshing, with a tender but slightly chewy rice paper wrapper surrounding thin rice noodles, lettuce, herbs, and your choice of other ingredients. For today's version, I used shiso instead of lettuce for a more pronounced and complex herbal flavor.

If this is your first time making salad rolls, allow yourself a fair amount of time to prep all the ingredients and make the rolls. This isn't a weeknight dinner for a busy family with young kids kind of thing. It will probably take you a few tries to get the hang of rolling them up neatly, but don't worry, even your failures will still be delicious. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CaadFo3sw0" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> is worth watching to see the right moves - you can skip to about 2:00 in to skip the cooking of the meat she's using. You could also try her more traditional peanut and hoisin dipping sauce instead of the sweet chili version below.

Two of these rolls per person is a good sized appetizer; three and you are up into light lunch territory.

Oh: the kind of rice paper you want is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000CNU2X/?tag=poeticlicen07-20" target="_blank">like this</a>. It should say bánh tráng on the package and not be flavored with anything like sesame.
