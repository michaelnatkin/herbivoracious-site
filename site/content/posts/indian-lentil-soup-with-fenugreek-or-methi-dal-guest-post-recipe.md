I think Sala has a great looking blog, with delicious vegetarian recipes that reflect a global sensibility. Her recent post on how to make the <a href="http://www.veggiebelly.com/2011/03/perfect-dosa-recipe.html" target="_blank">perfect dosa and idli </a>at home blew my mind. I invited her to write a guest post because I thought you would all enjoy getting to know her, so please do jump over there and check it out.</strong></p> <p>When Michael invited me to guest post on Herbivoracious, I wanted to bring you a simple, yet delicious and satisfying recipe. Dal and rice is a humble, comforting, every day meal in India. I grew up eating a wide range of dals (lentils), but my favorite is a mild red dal with a little fresh fenugreek or baby spinach stirred in.</p> <p><a href="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834014e8851803f970d-800wi.jpg" rel="lightbox" style="float: right;"><img alt="Fenugreek" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e008d618bb8834014e8851803f970d" src="/images/old/6a00e008d618bb8834014e8851803f970d-250wi.jpg" style="width: 250px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Fenugreek" /></a> Fenugreek, also called methi in India, is a beautiful herb with a pleasantly bitter taste and a ton of medicinal properties. The little leaves wilt easily, so all you have to do is stir the fenugreek into the dal in the last few minutes of cooking.</p> <p>Fresh fenugreek is available in Indian and Asian stores. Substitute with 2 tablespoons dried fenugreek or 1 cup spinach, or both. You can use any kind of lentils in this recipe, I love the color and texture of red lentils for this recipe.</p> <p>Serve this fenugreek dal as a soup, or as a main dish with some steamed rice or Indian flat bread (like rotis, chappatis or naan). But my personal favorite accompaniment to the dal is my<a href="http://www.veggiebelly.com/2011/01/paella-style-spiced-tomato-rice.html" target="_blank"> south Indian tomato rice</a>!</p> <p><strong>Check out more of Veggie Belly&#39;s&#0160;<a href="http://www.veggiebelly.com/tag/lentils">lentil recipes </a>and <a href="http://www.veggiebelly.com/tag/indian">Indian recipes</a>!</strong></p> <div class="recipe-card">
