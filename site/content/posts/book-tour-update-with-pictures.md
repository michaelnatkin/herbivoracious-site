I'm in the middle of a two week swing around the country to <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/">introduce my cookbook</a>. It has been just an incredible trip so far. In the past week I've been to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, DC, and now I've just landed in Boston and already done one signing. Everyone has been so kind and generous in showing me around their cities, talking about the book, and generally making me feel utterly welcome.

I haven't been able to take too many photos, but here is a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82984408@N00/sets/72157629972391789">gallery of a few favorite moments</a>. I know a lot of other folks have taken pictures at some of the events - if you have any, please share a link to them in the comments.

I'll be out on the road for one more week, with events in Boston, Providence, Philadelphia and New York. Details below. Please come out if you can, it would be a pleasure to meet you!
