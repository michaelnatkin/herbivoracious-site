She put our whole bowl of fruit, which is usually on the counter, in the cold oven, shut the door, and (no denying) put a post-it note right next to the oven controls. And I was there to witness it. But then Mini-Me wanted to bake more muffins this morning. Corn muffins this time, which were yum. Anyhow, I somehow missed the note and preheated the oven to 425, convection. When I went to put the muffins in, surprise! Roasted nectarines, mango and bananas, all in their skins. And avocados too. Now technically I should have tasted the avocados in the spirit of experimentation and serendipity. But I couldn't bring myself to do it, they went in the compost. I did learn though that it is super-easy to peel nectarines after they have roasted for awhile.&nbsp; I had some leftover pastry crust in the freezer, so I tossed all the fruit with cinammon, rolled out the crust and put it on top, cut some vents, and baked til it was golden brown. Sprinkled demerera <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VEJX49U?tag=herb-hugo-20">sugar</a> on top, bruleed it with the blow torch, and ate it with some heavy cream shaken with sugar and vanilla. Turned out pretty awesome. Oh, and here are the muffins, pretty much straight outta Joy of Cooking, except with mild goat milk yogurt instead of buttermilk.</p>  <p><a rel="lightbox" href="/images/2007/08/04/corn_muffins.jpg"><img width="455" height="302" border="0" src="/images/2007-small/08/04/corn_muffins.jpg" title="Corn_muffins" alt="Corn_muffins" /></a>   <br /></p>
