<em>Vegetarian tacos filled with grilled tofu and peppers, flavored with achiote</em>

The secret to delicious Mexican vegetarian food (or vegan, for that matter) is to amp up the flavors and use lots of contrasting textures. These vegetarian tacos have that serious street food flavor, filled with grilled tofu and sauteed peppers, all basted with tangy achiote. They are meant to be just two or three bites. Pick 'em up, lean over your plate, and get on in there or you'll be wearing some very tasty juices.

Making these tacos is easy, but to get started you'll need to gather and make some components:
<ul class="NormalBullets">
	<li>Top notch corn tortillas - if you can find a place that makes them locally, it will dominate the grocery store brands.</li>
	<li style="font-family: inherit;"><a href="/2009/11/ridiculously-good-guacamole-recipe/" target="_blank">Ridiculously good guacamole</a></li>
	<li><a href="/2010/04/grilled-pineapple-salsa-recipe/" target="_blank">Grilled pineapple salsa</a></li>
</ul>
If you haven't cooked with achiote (annatto) before, the easiest way is to buy a preground box. It comes as a slightly moist little brick. It isn't always easy to find the whole seeds. El Yucateco brand is nice because it doesn't have (or need) any synthetic food coloring added. It seems so silly that some brands add color, considering annatto already is a food coloring, the one typically used to give cheddar cheese that orange tint.
