People always ask me <strong>where to eat in Seattle</strong>. Sometimes they want to know where to find the best vegetarian options, others just want to know what restaurants are great, period. I love the food scene here, so it is a pleasure to help, and I've put together a few lists I can send.

So when Escape Apps asked if I'd like to work with them on a Seattle guide app, it took me about <strong>5 seconds of thought</strong> to say yes. How could I resist, when their stated mission is to get you to "Escape. Out of your phone and into the world."

Now I can focus on telling you which places I love and why, and they can provide a great app with a clean UI, maps and directions, phone numbers and all the other basic stuff that takes the hassle out of planning your next meal. I'll even be able to update it periodically as restaurants come and go. (And yes, I make a bit of money when the app sells!)

This is most definitely not Yelp. These choices are my own, individual, highly biased opinions. If you like the food you see on my site, you have a pretty good idea about my sensibility and whether it will match up with your own.

The restaurant list has a mix of places that have fully vegetarian or vegan menus, along with many others that are simply among the finest restaurants in the city. <strong>For omnivorous restaurants</strong>, I tip you off to the best vegetarian menu items. I'd be surprised if you can leave anyplace I've recommended without a smile.

I've got spots in there where you can spend less than $5 for lunch and others where you'll be lucky to get out for $100 at dinner, so whatever your mood and budget, there is lots to enjoy.

When I visit a new city, I don't just hit restaurants, I also make pilgrimages to <strong>great food-related retailers and markets</strong>, so I've included a selection of those spots as well.

If you have an Apple device, I hope you'll <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/herbivoracious-seattle-seattles/id546192591?ls=1&amp;amp;mt=8" target="_blank">jump over to the app store</a>, pick up a copy, share it with your friend on Facebook, <a href="http://clicktotweet.com/RNecr" target="_blank">tweet about it</a>, and <strong>give it a 5-star rating</strong> (if you think it deserves it!)
