recipe:
  name: "Peach and Sour Cream Buckle"
  yield: "8 For the streusel:"
  diet: "Vegan, Vegetarian"
  ingredients:
    - "1/2 cup sugar"
    - "6 tablespoons all-purpose flour"
    - "1/4 teaspoon cinnamon"
    - "1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt or sea salt"
    - "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold butter, cut into small pieces"
    - "1 3/4 cups whole wheat pastry flour"
    - "2 teaspoons baking powder"
    - "1 teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "4 tablespoons soft unsalted butter"
    - "1 cup sugar (I really meant to use half dark brown sugar, but forgot. If you do, let me know how it is)"
    - "1 large egg"
    - "1 teaspoon vanilla"
    - "1/2 cup sour cream"
    - "1/4 cup whole milk"
    - "3 cups peeled and sliced peaches (about 12 slices per peach)"
  instructions:
    - "Mix all ingredients except the butter in a small bowl. Add the butter and work it into the flour mixture with your fingertips until it looks like coarse cornmeal, just like when making a pie crust. It is fine if there are a few larger bits of butter. Refrigerate until ready to use."
    - "Preheat oven to 350. Butter a 9x9 baking pan."
    - "Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt."
    - "In a mixer, beat the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla until fluffy."
    - "Beat in the sour cream and milk."
    - "Gradually add the flour mixture and combine gently until just mixed, like you would for pancake batter."
    - "Gently fold in the peaches. Your hands are probably the best tool for this. It will seem like way too many peaches."
    - "Pour the batter in the pan, and sprinkle on the streusel top evenly."
    - "Bake until browned and a toothpick comes out clean, about 40 minutes."
    - "Let cool for 20 minutes and serve while still warm, with vanilla ice cream, yes."
