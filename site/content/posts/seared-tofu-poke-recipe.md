<p>Poke (pronounced POH-keh) is the Hawaiian equivalent of sashimi or crudo. Poke is typically raw fish, seasoned with soy and onion, often on a bed of seaweed. This vegetarian version is made with seared tofu, which matches those Asian flavors perfectly.</p>
<p>For the seaweed, the best option is any fresh variety that is thin enough to eat raw. Keep your eye out for Sea Tangle brand in the refrigerator section of health food or Asian groceries; they make a delicious fresh mixed seaweed that is packed in salt; you simply rinse it and enjoy. The other option is dried hijiki, which must be rehydrated.</p>
<p>You can serve this poke at room temperature or chilled.</p>

<p><strong>Seared Tofu Poke</strong>
<br /><em>Vegan and Gluten-Free / Serves 4 / 20 minutes</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup ogo, limukohu, hijiki or mixed seaweed (see above)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>8 ounces firm tofu cut into 2” x 1” x ½” rectangles, thoroughly patted dry</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Asian toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon sweet soy sauce (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00886AVOI?tag=herb-hugo-20">kecap manis</a>)</li>
<li>1 tablespoon shoyu</li>
<li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sriracha hot sauce or wasabi (optional)</li>
<li>¼ cup thinly sliced green onions or Maui onions</li>
<li>½ thinly sliced jalapeno pepper (optional)</li>
<li>Hawaiian sea salt</li>
<li>1 cup mung bean sprouts (or try kaiware radish sprouts for a spicy variation)</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Hydrate or rinse the seaweed according to the package directions. If it isn’t thinly sliced, make it so.</li>
<li>Put a large, preferably cast-iron, skillet over high heat. Add the vegetable oil and fry the tofu pieces in a single layer until well browned on both sides, about five minutes. Remove to paper towels.</li>
<li>Whisk together the sesame oil, sweet soy sauce, shoyu, fresh ginger and sriracha. Toss the tofu in the sauce and let rest for 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, reserving the sauce, and toss the tofu with most of the green onions and jalapeno, reserving a little for garnish.</li>
<li>To serve, divide the bean sprouts among 4 bowls. Drain and pat dry the seaweed and place a small mound atop the bean sprouts. Cover that with the tofu and drizzle on some of the remaining sauce. Garnish with the remaining green onion and jalapeno and a few grains of Hawaiian sea salt.</li>
</ol>
