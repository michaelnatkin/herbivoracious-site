<p>Harissa is the classic spice paste of North Africa, used in stews, as a rub, and as a condiment at the table. Oil infused with harissa is terrific for grilling vegetables, and I also like it drizzled on soups, such as the Red Lentil and Kabocha Squash soup on . You can also use a small amount of this oil to spice up a vinaigrette for dressing salads or dipping bread.</p>
<p>If you happen to have harissa paste, you can make harissa oil by just pureeing the paste with olive oil and straining. If not, you can make it a quick approximation using the recipe below. It will keep in the refrigerator for a few days.</p>
<p>Sumac is a bright red powder with a mild tangy flavor. Check a Middle Eastern market or online retailer to find it.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Harissa Oil</strong>
<br /><em>Vegan and gluten-free / Yields about 5 tablespoons / 15 minutes</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons Sriracha or other chile paste</li>
<li>1 teaspoon chile flakes</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>½ teaspoon caraway seeds</li>
<li>½ teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
<li>2 teaspoons sumac powder</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Place all ingredients in a small saucepan over low heat for about 5 minutes. Do not allow the spices to sizzle; we don’t want them to cook, just to get warm enough for their flavors to infuse the oil quickly. Remove from heat and let sit for 5 more minutes.</li>
<li>Puree all of the ingredients with a stick blender or a mini-food processor. Strain through a fine sieve and the oil is ready to use.</li>
</ol>
