  name: "Chanterelle Mushrooms with a Corn Sauce and Asian Pear Slaw"
  yield: "4 as an appetizer30 minutes"
  ingredients:
    - "kernels from 2 ears of corn"
    - "1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger"
    - "1/2 teaspoon sugar"
    - "Kosher salt"
    - "1 tablespoon unsalted butter"
    - "2 tablespoons vegetable oil"
    - "12 ounces chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned and halved lengthwise"
    - "1/2 cup finely julienned Asian pear (aka apple-pear)"
    - "1 tablespoon finely julienned red onion"
    - "1 tablespoon Asian toasted sesame oil"
    - "1 tablespoon lime juice"
    - "1 tablespoon toasted black sesame seeds"
    - "flaky sea salt (Maldon (aka the world's greatest salt)!) or other finishing salt of your choice"
    - "a few leaves of flat-leaf parsley"
  instructions:
    - "In a mini food processor or blender, puree the living heck out of the corn kernels, ginger, 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of Kosher salt. Let it run a good couple of minutes. Strain the resulting mixture very thoroughly, using either several layers of cheesecloth or multiple passes through first a coarse and then a very fine sieve. Be sure to extract and reserve as much liquid as possible. Discard the solids."
    - "Put the corn liquid and butter in a small saucepan over low heat and bring to a simmer, whisking occasionally. As soon as it comes up to temperature, you will see it begin to thicken rapidly. Continue to cook for 2 more minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Take a spoonful and allow to cool slightly. It should have the texture of pudding. If it is too thick, add water, a tablespoon at a time. Set aside to cool to room temperature."
    - "Heat the oil in a large skillet over a high flame. Add the mushrooms, season with big pinch of salt, and fry, stirring occasionally, until tender and well browned, about 5 minutes."
    - "Meanwhile, toss together the Asian pear, red onion, sesame oil, lime juice, and a big pinch of salt. Taste and adjust seasoning."
    - "To serve, whisk the corn sauce, then put about 2 tablespoons of it in the center of each of 4 small plates, spreading it slightly with the back of a spoon. Top with 1/4 of the mushrooms, 2 tablespoons of the Asian pear slaw, a few flakes of sea salt, and a few leaves of parsley. Serve immediately."

Using the transitive property of delicio-algebraics, I determined that I&#39;d like chanterelles with ginger. Heck, why not all three together?</p> <p>Grant Achatz has <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DD123EF934A1575BC0A9609C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">famously made a corn sauce</a> in sheet form, by cooking pureed corn kernels until the natural starch thickens the juice, and then freezing it in a thin sheet, to be draped over your completed dish. I used the first part of this idea here, but skip the potentially hairy part of freezing the sauce and then trying to get it off of the wax paper. Instead, I just served the sauce directly. It has a lovely, velvety texture and an intense flavor of sweet corn accented with ginger.</p> <p>The quick slaw of Asian pear with red onion and sesame oil add a nice bit of crunch and sweetness. You could take this element and serve it with almost any kind of fritter or even on a fusion taco with good results.</p> <div class="recipe-card">
