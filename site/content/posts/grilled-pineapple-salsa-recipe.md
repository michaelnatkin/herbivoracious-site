I served it with tacos that I&#39;ll cover it my next post, but it could work well in a Southeast Asian context too, especially if you added lemongrass and/or ginger. It is plenty tasty to polish off with a bag of chips at midnight too; if there was a security camera in my kitchen, I could prove it.</p>  <p>You will have to butcher your own pineapple to make this, because if you buy it already cut up, it will be in chunks too small to grill effectively. I was going to describe how to do that, but it turns out there is a website devoted solely to that specific topic: <a href="http://www.howtocutapineapple.com/" target="_blank">howtocutapineapple.com</a>. Talk about working a niche! Follow the pictures there through the part where the skin is fully removed, and then slice into vertical planks instead of horizontal. You&#39;ll only need half of it for this recipe, you can save the rest for a salad with tiny marshmallows and vegan spam chunks.</p>  <p>If you have a grill going for other reasons, just use that. If not, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008GKDQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00008GKDQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lodge cast-iron grill pan</a> is a great alternative. It has a ridged grill on one side, which I used for the pineapple, and a flat griddle on the other, which I use for pancakes. Be sure and grill the pineapple long enough to drive off some moisture and develop caramelized flavors.</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
