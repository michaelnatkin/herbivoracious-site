Tortas are Mexican sandwiches. They generally have a base of refried beans, which can be topped with just about anything. In the video I'll show you a version with avocado and a moderately picante roasted poblano pepper, with a simple cabbage slaw for some added crunch. In <a href="/get-the-herbivoracious-cookbook/" target="_blank">my cookbook</a> I've got a breakfast variation with scrambled eggs that is a messy, delicious good time!

The avocado I use in the video is a very special <a href="http://chefshop.com/Fresh-Reed-Avocados-West-Coast--P6786.aspx" target="_blank">Reed variety</a> that I get in season from ChefShop.com. They are huge and buttery with a tiny little pit. (Of course a regular Hass will do if you don't have the Reed.)

Oh, and I wanted to mention that I've updated my <a href="/herbivoracious-around-the-web-press-clippings/" target="_blank">press clippings page</a> to include all of the wonderful coverage, about the cookbook while I was on tour. I'm so grateful for all of the traditional media, bloggers and readers that have been helping to get the word out. If you want to eat a meatless meal, let's make sure it is delicious!
