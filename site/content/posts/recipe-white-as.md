My first event is going to be an asparagus tasting menu, a celebration of Spring coming to the Northwest. It isn't for a few weeks, and neither is local asparagus! I'm having to test with California spears for now.</p>  <p>(By the way, the first dinner is full, but if you are interested in attending a future event in Seattle, drop me a line at herbivoracious  gmail  com, with &quot;dinner&quot; in the subject, and I'll keep you posted).</p>  <p>This salad has been marinating in mind for a bit. No pun intended. I wanted to do something with thinly sliced raw <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096BL9292?tag=herb-hugo-20">white asparagus</a>, which has a nice vegetable sweetness and crunch to it. In this version I paired it with watercress, cipollini onions, aged pecorino romano, and a grapefruit vinaigrette. Everything worked really well, but the vinaigrette needs some work to bring out more of the citrus flavor. Grapefruit is a lot less acidic than lemon, so that makes sense to me. I think next time I will try using more of the zest and a little bit of a neutrally flavored&nbsp; vinegar.</p>  <p>Here's an approximate recipe:</p>  <div class="recipe-card">
