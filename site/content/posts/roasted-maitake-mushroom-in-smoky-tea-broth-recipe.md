  name: "Roasted Maitake Mushroom in Smoky Tea Broth"
  yield: "4"
  ingredients:
    - "1 pound fresh maitake mushroom"
    - "½ cup small-diced bok choy stem"
    - "3 tablespoons vegetable oil"
    - "½ teaspoon Kosher salt"
    - "2 teaspoons lapsang souchong tea"
    - "1 tablespoon tamari"
    - "toasted sesame oil"
    - "flaky sea salt"
    - "2 teaspoons finely sliced green onion"
  instructions:
    - "Preheat oven to 450 F, using convection if available. Set 4 shallow soup bowls aside to warm."
    - "Place the bok choy in a small bowl with a tablespoon of water and microwave on high for one minute. (Alternatively, you can steam the bok choy or blanch in boiling water). Reserve."
    - "Divide the mushroom into 4 portions (leaving the pieces as large as possible) and place on a rimmed sheet tray. Toss with the vegetable oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt. Roast until fragrant, starting to brown, and becoming tender, about 20 minutes."
    - "While the mushrooms are roasting, cover the lapsang souchong tea with 2 cups boiling water and allow to steep 5 minutes. Strain. Add the tamari. Taste and season with a bit of salt if needed. The broth should be smoky, with a distinct note of soy and mildly salty."
    - "When the mushrooms are ready, place one portion in each bowl. Place the bok choy dice around the maitake. Reheat the tea in the microwave and divide among the 4 bowls. Garnish each bowl with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil, a pinch of flaky sea salt, and the green onions. Serve piping hot."

<p>Maitake mushrooms are very popular in Japan. In the US, they are known as Hen-of-the-woods (not to be confused with chicken-of-the-woods, which is completely different!). Maitakes are rather expensive and unique, so when I use them, I like to make them the focus of a dish.</p>
<p>If you have never had <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JP6H2O?tag=herb-hugo-20">lapsang souchong tea</a>, you are in for a treat. It is intensely smoky, unlike any other tea I’ve had. That smokiness makes a perfect broth base to show off the earthiness of roasted maitakes.</p>
<p>You could cut the maitake up into bite sized pieces, but this dish is more dramatic when the mushroom is served in larger piece, and it also keeps the mushroom from getting soggy. Give the guests a knife to cut it at the last moment.</p>
