<p>You should have a metal or ceramic “steel” that can be used in between sharpenings to keep an edge on your knife. Sliding the edge of your knife against the steel removes any burrs and realigns the cutting edge. A sharp knife is a safer knife, because you don't have to use excess force that can cause it to slip.</p>
<p>Using a steel is a lot easier to do than to describe, so I've got a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xERHFntQzYI">short video</a> to show you how.</p>
<p>Here are two options - a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071FC4GYN?tag=herb-hugo-20">metal honing steel</a> for straightening the edge, or a very fine <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YK1RAQ?tag=herb-hugo-20">ceramic sharpening steel</a> that actually does a bit of sharpening. I like them both.</p>
