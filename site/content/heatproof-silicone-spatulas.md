I still love my wooden spoons, but honestly I reach for silicone spatulas much more often these days. Silicone spatulas are versatile. It is worth owning a few in different sizes and shapes, because they can <strong>scrape out containers</strong> with various contours (even blender jars), <strong>mix ingredients for baking</strong>, and stir hot ingredients. They are also <strong>safe for use in nonstick skillets</strong>, because they won’t damage the coating. This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BJT61FE?tag=herb-hugo-20" target="_blank">model from GIR</a> is my <strong>all-time favorite</strong>. It has the perfect degree of flex, and a unibody design so there is nowhere for grime to hide. The angled edge works great for getting into corners.
