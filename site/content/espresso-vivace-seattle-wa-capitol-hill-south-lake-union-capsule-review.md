<p>I'm sitting in Espresso Vivace's new Capitol Hill location as I write. The venerable Broadway and Denny location closed awhile back, and was transported almost intact to 532 Broadway Ave East, in the retail floor of a condo development. They also have an outdoor location a couple blocks south, and another store in South Lake Union (see address info at the end).</p><p>I'm going to keep this simple: Vivace makes the best espresso in America. That might seem like an overly strong statement, but I stand by it. David Schomer, the owner, has devoted himself to perfecting the roasting and extraction techniques, down to the exact number of atmospheres of pressure. He literally wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0897166159?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=poeticlicen07-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0897166159">the book</a>. His baristas are impeccably trained and almost always make perfect shots. The roast has a sweet, caramelized creama that is unmatched in my opinion. It is great in drinks, but at perfection when enjoyed as a double shot, in a porcelain cup, within a minute of brewing.</p><p>Go there now and have one.</p><p> <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/5718/restaurant/Capitol-Hill/Espresso-Vivace-Seattle"><img  alt="Espresso Vivace on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/5718/biglink.gif" style="border: medium none ; width: 200px; height: 146px;"></a> <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/1/8112/restaurant/Eastlake-Lake-Union/Espresso-Vivace-Alley-24-Seattle"><img  alt="Espresso Vivace Alley 24 on Urbanspoon" src="http://www.urbanspoon.com/b/link/8112/biglink.gif" style="border: medium none ; width: 200px; height: 146px;"></a></p>
